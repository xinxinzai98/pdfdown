AB  - Nickel (oxy)hydroxide electrodes are widely used in alkaline batteries and water electrolyzers. Their operation involves reversible phase transformations (Ni(OH)2 + OH-NiOOH + H2O + e-) upon charge and discharge at potentials below the onset of oxygen evolution; electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH- -> O2 + 2H2O + 4e-) at higher potentials; and spontaneous chemical self-discharge (4NiOOH + 2H2O -> 4Ni(OH)2 + O2) that is accelerated at elevated temperatures. This work studied compositional and microstructural changes in nickel-boride-based electrodes during cold (room temperature) charge and hot (95 degrees C) self-discharge cycles that enable decoupled membraneless water electrolysis. Pristine electrodes comprised agglomerates of equiaxed nickel boride nanoparticles that transformed into boron-depleted Ni(OH)2 platelets upon chemical aging and electrochemical activation treatments followed by operation in cold charge and hot self-discharge cycles. Cyclic operation in alternating cold and hot alkaline electrolytes resulted in crystallization and growth of mosaic hexagonal plates that seem to have been formed by detachment of small platelets from the agglomerates and oriented reattachment onto the edges of the growing plates. Concomitant with the plate growth, the self- discharge kinetics (at 95 degrees C) decreased from one cycle to another whilst the OER kinetics (at room temperature) slightly enhanced. This observation suggests that bulk processes involving solid-state diffusion and phase transformation limit the rate of thermally activated self-discharge rather than OER. This finding sheds new light on the mechanism of the self-discharge reaction that limits the performance of alkaline batteries and decoupled alkaline water electrolyzers.

AB  - In this study, the side reactions that greatly affect the coulombic efficiency of a zinc-air secondary battery are quantitatively analyzed on the basis of the charging-discharging characteristics, open circuit self-discharge characteristics, and a series of calculations. In particular, the charge amounts consumed by water electrolysis and self-discharge during charging process are separately determined so that the charging efficiency (the amount of charge used in actual charging with respect to the applied charge amount) can be estimated, which would enable systematic understanding of the cause of coulombic efficiency degradation. Using two cells with different charging overvoltages, the validity of the proposed method can be assessed.

AB  - Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) offer cost-effective hydrogen production, but face challenges in electrode durability such as oxidation upon load fluctuation. This study investigates the degradation of Pt-based alloy catalysts under intermittent and reverse current conditions. Under intermittent protocol, which involves alternating current density at open circuit voltage (OCV), 0.1 A cm-2, and 1 A cm-2 for 50 h, the PtNi/C, PtCo/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C catalysts demonstrated comparable durability, with PtNi/C showing the least degradation. The reverse current protocol, which applies-30 mA cm-2 for 30 min, resulted in pronounced catalyst deterioration, particularly in PtRu/C, due to extensive Ru dissolution. In contrast, PtNi/C exhibited superior durability, likely attributed to the formation of a protective Ni hydroxide layer. The degradation of the cathode was separately estimated from that of the anode using a three-electrode-integrated AEMWE system. PtNi/C would be a highly durable cathode catalyst for AEMWE which operates stably under various load fluctuation scenarios. These findings provide valuable insights into catalyst development for durable AEMWEs, contributing to the advancement of sustainable hydrogen production.

AB  - Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have shown a significant rise in performance and durability within recent years for applications such as electrolysis and fuel cells. However, in vanadium redox-flow batteries, their use is of particular interest to lower costs and self-discharge rates compared to conventional perfluorinated sulfonic acid-based ionomers such as Nafion. In this work we evaluate the properties of two commercial AEMs, Aemion (TM) and Aemion+(TM), based on ex situ characterizations, an accelerated stress test degradation study (>1000 hours storage in highly oxidizing VO2+ electrolyte at 35 degrees C) and electrochemical battery cycle tests. All membranes feature low ionic resistances of below 320 m omega cm(2), enabling battery cycling at 100 mA cm(-2). Aemion shows considerable VO2+ formation within a VO2+ stress test, whereas Aemion+ remains almost unaffected in the 1058 h stress test. Evaluating self-discharge data, cycling performance and durability data, Aemion+(TM) (50 mu m thickness) features the best properties for vanadium redox-flow battery operation.

AB  - Developing durable platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts is critical for enabling cost-effective hydrogen production through anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, this study presents NiMo catalysts encapsulated within defective carbon shells. Whereas conventional NiMo catalysts degrade rapidly under intermittent conditions with voltage changes, the carbon-encapsulated NiMo catalysts exhibit remarkable resistance to degradation with good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, effectively addressing the challenges associated with renewable energy integration. The carbon shells prevent oxidation-induced deactivation by inhibiting the structural transformation of metallic Ni into hydroxides accompanying volumetric expansion under open circuit voltage conditions. Using a reference electrode-integrated AEMWE, overpotential contributions are decoupled and demonstrated that the stability of HER catalyst is decisive for the durable AEMWE operation under intermittent scenarios. This study establishes a strategy for durable PGM-free catalyst development for sustainable and scalable hydrogen production.

AB  - In this study, the stability of an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) cell was evaluated in an on-off cycling operation with respect to an applied electric bias, i.e., a current density of 500 mA cm(-2), and an open circuit. The ohmic and polarization resistances of the system were monitored during operation (similar to 800 h) using electrochemical impedance spectra. Specific consideration was given to the ohmic resistance of the cell, especially that of the membrane under on-off cycling conditions, by consistently feeding the cell with KOH solution. Owing to an excess feed solution, a momentary increase in the polarization resistance was observed immediately after the open-circuit. The excess feed solution was mostly recovered by subjecting the cell to the applied electric bias. Stability tests on the AEMWE cell under on-off cycling with continuous feeding even under an open circuit can guarantee long-term stability by avoiding an irreversible increase in ohmic and polarization resistances.

AB  - In combination with renewably generated power, anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) must prove the ability for intermittent operation. This requires a better understanding of the shutdown behavior of an AEMWE system under industrially relevant conditions. On system level, the effect of shutdown parameters on the discharge behavior is analyzed and the regeneration effect of reversible degradation is unraveled for the first time. The influence of shutdown parameters on irreversible degradation is examined, which - among other findings - reveals that cooling the stack after shutdown reduces degradation by over 92%. Subsequently, constituents of degradation are disentangled. The results reveal how harmful shutdowns can be (337 mu V cycle(-1)), but the study also shows how degradation due to start-stop operation - contrary to the common understanding in literature - can be reduced to ranges that are no longer identified as degradation. From an overarching perspective, this proves the ability of AEMWE for intermittent operation.

AB  - Nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), an active material for alkaline Zn-NiOOH batteries, was synthesized by electrolysis oxidation of different Ni(OH)(2) precursors, which were prepared by three methods: polyacrylamide (PAM) assisted two-step drying (PTSD), conventional co-precipitation (CCP), and "controlled crystallization" (CC). The NiOOH samples were characterized and tested using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) testing, laser particle size analysis, tap-density testing, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and a discharge test. The results demonstrate that the physical and electrochemical properties of NiOOH are strongly dependent on the properties of the Ni(OH)(2) precursor, such as its morphology, microstructure, tap density, and specific surface area. The results of the electrochemical studies also show that the sample prepared by the PTSD method is superior to the others in electrochemical performance. The as-prepared, high-density, non-spherical NiOOH is a promising active material for the positive electrode in Zn-NiOOH batteries. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Water electrolysis using anion exchange membranes ispromisingfor hydrogen production, and Ni-Mo catalysts have shown highactivity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However,their performance has been mostly tested in a half-cell setup andrarely studied in a single-cell setup with a membrane electrode assembly(MEA) structure, which is used for practical applications. With Ni3Mo as the cathode, a single cell was fabricated using non-noblemetal catalysts exclusively. Interestingly, the activation proceduresignificantly affected the cell performance. The single cell performedbetter than that with the Pt/C catalyst when the Ni(3)Mocatalyst was mildly activated. The distribution of Mo in electrodes,membrane, and electrolytes was estimated, confirming Mo dissolutionfrom the cathode. Once the cell was activated, the cell performancewas stable without degradation in long-term chronopotentiometry operation,but the performance was degraded by sudden voltage change such asimposing open circuit voltage (OCV). The surface structure and reactionmechanism were studied with density functional theory: the Mo-dissolvedNi(3)Mo(101) surface could promote H2O dissociation,while MoO3 stably adsorbed on the surface weakened H* adsorption,promoting HER. This study provides important insights into the developmentof efficient catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production.

AB  - For the large-scale commercialization of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), it is essential to develop electrocatalysts that exhibit both high activity and durability. Here, we investigate the performance of membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) up to a current density of 4 A cm-2, as well as durability assessments, including startup (4 A cm-2, 10 s) and shutdown (0.1 V, 10 s) cycles and constant current density (1 A cm-2) and load fluctuations (0-2 A cm-2) cycles at 80 degrees C, of AEMWE single cells using several in-house developed Ni-based oxide catalysts (NiCoO X , NiCoMoO X , NiFeO X ) for the anode, and the in-house developed anion exchange ionomer (QPAF-4) for both the membrane and the catalyst layer binder. The results of the 2000-cycle accelerated degradation test demonstrate the extremely high stability of NiFeO X , together with high MEA performance, 1.94 V@4 A cm-2, achieved after the durability test. Based on these results, we provide strategies for the development of electrocatalysts achieving high performance and durability on the MEA level.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel electrolysis method to prepare NiOOH by oxidizing spherical Ni(OH)(2) in a dilute alkaline solution (pH = 8-13). The effects of preparation conditions, including KCl concentration, pH, constant voltage, temperature and oxidation time, on the synthesis of NiOOH were systematically investigated. The results show that the electrolytic efficiency and reaction rate are superior and the electrolyte can be conveniently re-utilized. The physical properties and electrochemical performance of NiOOH samples were also studied. The results show that the NiOOH, prepared by this electrolysis method, is pure beta phase, even if the electrolysis duration is fully prolonged. The spherical NiOOH sample not only possesses excellent electrochemical activities, providing discharge capacities of 256.5 and 199.1 mAh g(-1), and volume capacities of 625.86 and 485.80 mAh cm(-3) at rates of 0.2 C and 3 C, respectively, but also has the high tap density of 2.44 g cm(-3). Moreover, the synthesis process of the new electrolysis method is environmentally friendly, cost saving, and efficient for a large-scale production. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

AB  - In order to efficiently operate the alkaline water electrolyzers with renewable energy, behaviors of the electrolyzer during start-up or shut-down must be unveiled, because they might be suffered by reverse current that naturally flows. The mechanism of the reverse current in alkaline water electrolyzer having relation between the electrolyzer operating conditions and cell voltage has been investigated using a bipolar-type electrolyzer which consists of two cells. The electrodes were nickel mesh, which are conventional electrodes for alkaline water electrolyzer. The amount of natural reverse current measured during off-load was proportional to the current loaded until just before stopping the operation. The increase in the charge would result from the increasing oxide on the anode of the bipolar plate. Cell voltages were above 1.4 V at all cases just when the electrolyzer is forcibly opened the circuit to stop. The major redox couple of the reverse current would be [NiO2/NiOOH] and [H-2/H2O] due to the cell voltage and the redox couples. The open circuit cell voltage of the cathode terminal side cell gradually decreased to 0.3 V, while that of the anode terminal side cell was maintained above 1.1 V. Therefore, nickel oxides on the anode of the bipolar plate would be reduced, and the cathodic active material of hydrogen and nickel for the cathode side of the bipolar plate would be oxidized during the reverse current flows. Ultimately, the reverse current would stop when the redox state of both sides of the bipolar plate had the same oxidation state.

AB  - Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems offer a cost-effective and scalable approach for large-scale hydrogen production using renewable energy sources. However, their susceptibility to load fluctuations, particularly the reverse-current (RC) phenomenon during shutdown events, poses a significant challenge to the long-term stability and scalability of these systems. Herein, a catalytic approach for enhancing the RC tolerance in AWE systems by using Pb-decorated Ni cathode catalysts (Pb/Ni) is introduced. The oxidation of Pb/Ni by repeated RC lowers the electromotive force for the reverse current operation, and consequently, imparts RC tolerance. Intriguingly, contrary to the expectation that the decoration with lead, an inert material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), will interfere with the hydrogen generation of the Ni catalyst, the presence of Pb on the Ni cathode after the RC flow promotes both the proton desorption and water-dissociation steps, improving the HER activity. Furthermore, the AWE stack testing with Pb/Ni catalysts is perfectly operated, demonstrating remarkably enhanced RC tolerance during startup/shut-down (SU/SD) testing protocol. This paper presents a new strategy for mitigating the AWE performance degradation induced by RC flow and for achieving Pb/Ni catalysts with improved operational durability against RC flow in AWE systems.
   The transient stability of the catalyst caused by the reverse-current phenomenon during the shutdown of the AWE system by load fluctuations is one of the most challenging limitations to address. This study introduces a catalytic approach for enhancing the RC by decorating lead on Ni catalysts. The surface decoration of the Ni catalyst with Pb (Pb/Ni) catalyst exhibits improved HER activity as well as remarkable RC-flow resistance. image

AB  - A water electrolysis cell based on anion exchange membrane (AEM) and critical raw materials-free (CRM-free) electrocatalysts was developed. A NiFe-oxide electrocatalyst was used at the anode whereas a series of metallic electrocatalysts were investigated for the cathode, such as Ni, NiCu, NiMo, NiMo/KB. These were compared to a benchmark Pt/C cathode. CRMs-free anode and cathode catalysts were synthetized with a crystallite size of about 10 nm. The effect of recirculation through the cell of a diluted KOH solution was investigated. A concentration of 0.5-1 M KOH appeared necessary to achieve suitable performance at high current density. amongst the CRM-free cathodes, the NiMo/KB catalyst showed the best performance in the AEM electrolysis cell achieving a current density of 1 A cm(-2) at about 1.7-1.8 V/cell when it was used in combination with a NiFe-oxide anode and a 50 mu m thick Fumatech FAA-3-50 (R) hydrocarbon membrane. Durability tests showed an initial decrease of cell voltage with time during 2000 h operation at 1 A cm(-2) until reaching a steady state performance with an energy efficiency close to 80%. An increase of reversible losses during start-up and shutdown cycles was observed. Appropriate stability was observed during cycled operation between 0.2 and 1 A cm(-2); however, the voltage efficiency was slightly lower than in steady-state operation due to the occurrence of reversible losses during the cycles. Post operation analysis of electrocatalysts allowed getting a better comprehension of the phenomena occurring during the 2000 h durability test.

AB  - Ongoing improvements in the performance of anion exchange membranes (AEM) have renewed interest in alkaline water electrolysis for large-scale hydrogen production. New electrocatalysts are required to interface with such AEM water electrolyzers. Ni-Nb-Y amorphous and amorphous-nanocrystalline alloys were prepared by cryomilling and evaluated as electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. The roles of microstructure and chemistry on catalytic activity were investigated. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy identified Ni5Y nanocrystals finely dispersed in an amorphous Ni-Nb-Y matrix among the multiphase alloys. Capacitance measurements near open-circuit potential were used to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) in order to elucidate the activity of various catalyst morphologies on an intrinsic basis. Enhanced intrinsic activity from these multiphase structures were found in kinetic data from Tafel and impedance spectroscopic measurements. A multiphase Ni81.3Nb6.3Y12.5 catalyst displayed the greatest catalytic activity attributed to the presence of a nanocrystalline Ni5Y secondary phase finely dispersed in the Ni-Nb-Y amorphous matrix with increased yttrium content. These preliminary results demonstrate that ball milled Ni-based amorphous-based materials are promising catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production.

AB  - Ni based materials are studied widely for their application as electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis. To further understand and improve these materials, the study of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active NiOOH phase is necessary. However, the reversibility of the phase transition from Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH renders the study of the active phase with ex situ techniques difficult. Therefore, we have investigated the pathways and time evolution of the NiOOH decomposition at open circuit potential after the chronamperometric polarization of sputtered NiO thin films. The samples are characterised in situ and ex situ using Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. We show that the NiOOH phase formed under OER conditions (U > 1.5 V, 1 M KOH, room temperature) quickly degrades to Ni(OH)(2) when set to open circuit potential both inside and emersed from the electrolyte. We demonstrate that NiOOH can be detected ex situ, but only within a limited timeframe unless it is stabilised in a vacuum environment. H2O adsorption in ultra-high vacuum reveals that the reduction of NiOOH requires protons and electrons, which need to be generated by an oxidative reaction. Our results emphasize the importance of using in situ methods for the characterization of the active phase of the electrocatalyst to observe and understand in detail the processes occurring when analyzing post-catalysis samples by ex situ techniques.

AB  - The vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) offer attractive features such as long-term durability, easy scalability, and high performance. We report partial fluorinated PVDF-co-HFP based multi-cationic cross-linked anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with variable alkyl chain pendants for the VRFB. Presence of long pendant encouraged the formation of ionic clusters, and thus improved ionic conductivity. Cross-linked nature of PAB-CnPDA membranes, was confirmed by gel fraction and cross-linking density. Suitably optimized PAB-C8-PDA AEM revealed high ion-exchange capacity, conductivity and negligible VO2+ crossover, due to grafting of three moles of amine groups via side chain, responsible for "Donnan exclusion". The single cell VRFB performance of PAB-C8PDA membrane revealed high self-discharge time, and charge-discharge capacity. Long-term durability test of PAB-C8-PDA membrane was performed at 100 mA/cm2 for 300 cycles without any electrolyte rebalancing and deterioration in efficiencies. Further, PAB-C8-PDA membrane exhibited 243.5 mW/cm2 peak power density (PPD) at 340 mA/cm2 limiting current density, which is significantly high in compare with Nafion membrane. Furthermore, the cost-effective partial fluorinated membranes preparation strategy may open new windows for other energy devices such as fuel cells, electrolysis, and water treatment.

AB  - Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is regarded as a highly promising technology for the sustainable production of green hydrogen. The flow field configuration exerts a significant impact on the gas-liquid (H2O/O2) mass transfer behavior, thereby exerting an important effect on the overall performance of AEMWE. Lots of AEMWE research focuses on electrode material research and development, only a few studies are devoted to the flow field optimization. This work utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental validation to design a high-performance flow field, incorporating a modified distribution zone and a grooved nickel foam-based active area. The modified distribution zone incorporates an optimized direct-flow configuration so as to improve the uniformity of fluid distribution, thereby yielding a 9.74 % elevation in current density under an applied voltage of 2.0 V in comparison with the conventional distribution zone. The grooved nickel foam structure in the active area employs a vertical suction and lateral discharge mechanism, reducing high oxygen accumulation by more than 90 %, affording a 17.8 % current density performance enhancement at a cell voltage of 2.0 V over the ungrooved baseline.

AB  - Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a leading "green hydrogen" production technology. Industrial electrodes use alkaline leaching to remove Al from NiAl alloy, creating pores and increasing specific surface area (SSA) but still suffer from poor electrode performance. This study presents a method for fabricating an efficient bifunctional electrode. The process involves creating a porous Ni layer with high SSA on nickel mesh (NM) by reducing NiO, which facilitates the formation of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The resulting Ni/Ni(OH)2@NM electrode features a hydrophilic, gas-repellent and highly electrochemically active surface. It achieves low overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (164 mV and 337 mV at 100 mA/cm2, respectively). The electrolyzer using Ni/Ni (OH)2@NM electrodes only requires 1.695 V to achieve 300 mA/cm2 at 80 degrees C after a 2000 h durability test. The electrode also demonstrates excellent stability under frequent start-stop cycles, making it well-suited for integration with intermittent renewable energy sources.

AB  - Low-cost alkaline water electrolysis has been considered a sustainable approach to producing hydrogen using renewable energy inputs, but preventing hydrogen/oxygen mixing and efficiently using the instable renewable energy are challenging. Here, using nickel hydroxide as a redox mediator, we decouple the hydrogen and oxygen production in alkaline water electrolysis, which overcomes the gas-mixing issue and may increase the use of renewable energy. In this architecture, the hydrogen production occurs at the cathode by water reduction, and the anodic Ni(OH)(2) is simultaneously oxidized into NiOOH. The subsequent oxygen production involves a cathodic NiOOH reduction (NiOOH -> Ni(OH)(2)) and an anodic OH- oxidization. Alternatively, the NiOOH formed during hydrogen production can be coupled with a zinc anode to form a NiOOH-Zn battery, and its discharge product (that is, Ni(OH)(2)) can be used to produce hydrogen again. This architecture brings a potential solution to facilitate renewables-to-hydrogen conversion.

AB  - Electrodeposited Ni-Fe-C alloys have high electroactivity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis. In the present work carbon was introduced into Ni and Ni Fe alloys by plasma treatment in CH4 + H-2 gas mixture at 470 degrees C. Despite of a very low solubility of carbon in nickel, carbon entered into nickel to the depth of about 0.5 mu m. In high-Fe alloys it formed a carbide layer about 2-mu m thick and increased surface hardness. Electrochemical measurements in 25 wt.% KOH at 80 degrees C showed that carburization resulted in an improvement of catalytic activity toward HER, especially of Ni and 1Ni-Fe. Carburization also increased the resistance to corrosion during cathodic polarisation and under open circuit conditions. XPS surface analysis showed that after corrosion the oxide content on carburized materials was significantly lower than that on untreated materials. It is suggested that the enhanced electroactivity of plasma carburized cathodes was due mainly to the enlargement of the surface area of disintegrated material. Also, a catalytic effect might be exerted by carbon-metal particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nickel-based anodes are widely used in industrial alkaline electrolyzers, yet their long-term stability under dynamic operation remains poorly understood. Shutdowns in bipolar electrolyzers lead to reverse currents and discharging of the electrodes, triggering electrochemically driven phase transformations. In this study, we investigate the deterioration of bulk nickel 201 anodes subjected to repeated shutdown cycling, mimicking offgrid operation scenarios. While nickel is recognized for its excellent stability in alkaline environments, our results reveal strong correlations between anode mass loss and both the number and duration of shutdown cycles, with deterioration driven not by the reduction event itself but by the time spent in a reduced state. Elevated operation temperatures further accelerate this effect. Interestingly, moderate concentrations of iron in the electrolyte significantly suppress deterioration, likely by stabilizing nickel hydroxide phases and mitigating structural transformations. The data suggest that phase transitions between nickel hydroxide and oxyhydroxide allotropes introduce mechanical stress, leading to material detachment. These findings demonstrate how reverse currents have significant implications for the industrial design of electrodes, underscoring the importance of thick nickel coatings and robust catalyst-support interactions in electrolyzers operating under intermittent conditions.

AB  - The design of highly selective yet robust anion exchange membranes remains a challenge. Here, the authors prepare a stable polymer membrane composed of terphenyl isomers, demonstrate roll-to-roll manufacturing, and assess its properties in redox flow batteries, water electrolyzers and fuel cells.
   The lack of high-performance and substantial supply of anion-exchange membranes is a major obstacle to future deployment of relevant electrochemical energy devices. Here, we select two isomers (m-terphenyl and p-terphenyl) and balance their ratio to prepare anion-exchange membranes with well-connected and uniformly-distributed ultramicropores based on robust chemical structures. The anion-exchange membranes display high ion-conducting, excellent barrier properties, and stability exceeding 8000 h at 80 degrees C in alkali. The assembled anion-exchange membranes present a desirable combination of performance and durability in several electrochemical energy storage devices: neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (energy efficiency of 77.2% at 100 mA cm(-2), with negligible permeation of redox-active molecules over 1100 h), water electrolysis (current density of 5.4 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V, 90 degrees C, with durability over 3000 h), and fuel cells (power density of 1.61 W cm(-2) under a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2), with open-circuit voltage durability test over 1000 h). As a demonstration of upscaled production, the anion-exchange membranes achieve roll-to-roll manufacturing with a width greater than 1000 mm.

AB  - Alkaline water electrolysis is apreferred technology for large-scale green hydrogen production. For most active transition metal -based catalysts during anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the atomic structure of the anodic catalysts ' surface often undergoes reconstruction to optimize the reaction path and enhance their catalytic activity. The design and maintenance of highly active sites during this reconstruction process remain critical and challenging for most OER catalysts. In this study, we explored the effects of crystal structures in pre -catalysts on surface reconstruction at low applied potential. Through experimental observation and theoretical calculation, we found out that catalysts with specific crystal structures exhibit superior surface remodeling ability, which enables them to better adapt to the conditions of the oxygen evolution reaction and achieve efficient catalysis. The discharge process enables the formation of abundant phosphorus vacancies on the surface, which in turn affects the efficiency of the entire oxygen evolution reaction. The optimized crystal structure of the catalyst results in an increase as high as 58.5 mA/cm 2 for Ni 5 P 4 , which is twice as high as that observed for Ni 2 P. These results provide essential theoretical foundations and technical guidance for designing more efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions.

AB  - High-conductive and alkali-resistant alkaline membranes are needed for fuel cells and water electrolysis. In this work, the ether-free poly(biphenyl indole) (PBN) was synthesized by the means of super acid catalysis. Then comb-shaped piperidinium-functionalized PBN (PBN-Pip) membranes were prepared by the incorporations of 1-bromohexyl-N-methylpiperidinium and 1-bromohexane. The comb-shaped long side chains facilitated the formation of wide and connected ion transport channels. The PBN-Pip membrane possessed the conductivity of as high as 108 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C. The ether-free backbone and the hexyl spacers endowed the membrane with excellent stability. No degradation can be observed after immersion in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C for 1000 h. The single cell with this membrane exhibited the open circuit voltage of 1.02 V and the peak energy density of 404 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C. After the cell durability test for 120 h, the ohmic resistance of the cell and the chemical structure of the membrane both had no changes. All these suggest that the comb-shaped PBN membrane is very promising.

AB  - The electrocatalytic activity and corrosion performance of binary Fe53Mo47 and ternary Fe54Mo30P16 coated alloys were compared to Ni and mild steel electrodes. The electrochemical efficiency of the electrodes was studied based on steady-state polarization, electrochemical impedance and long-term stability tests in KOH 1 M solution at 25 degrees C at a current density of 250 mA cm(-2). The corrosion performance of these electrodes was determined via potentiodynamic measurements. The Fe54Mo30P16 electrode showed the best catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reduced the over potential close to 350 mV equal to 47% as compared to mild steel and Ni. However, the results of corrosion performance revealed poor resistance of Fe-Mo and Fe-Mo-P electrodes in comparison to Ni and mild steel. Although phosphorous addition to Fe53Mo47 enhanced the catalytic activity to HER, it deteriorated the corrosion performance of coated alloy. However, the corrosion of electrodes could be avoided by applying a protective voltage in order to create a cathodic protection or by avoiding the immersion of the electrodes in alkaline solution and their water washing during shut-down period.

AB  - A beta-FeOOH nanorod was investigated as a highly active and durable self-repairing anode catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis with repeated potential change, simulating power from renewable energy. The beta-FeOOH nanorod was synthesized by coprecipitation, using an organic buffer of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. The beta-FeOOH nanorods dispersed in 1 M KOH aq. as an alkaline electrolyte were electrochemically deposited on a nickel electrode by a constant current electrolysis. The deposited beta-FeOOH nanorods formed bundled network on the surface of the electrode and exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, where the minimum OER overpotential was 285 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). The durability of the nickel electrode coated with beta-FeOOH nanorods were tested via shutdown-based accelerated durability test, where electrolysis at 600 mA cm(-2) for 1 min and the potential control at 0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for 1 min are repeated in the presence of beta-FeOOH nanorod in the electrolyte. The catalyst coated electrode showed the low OER overpotential for 4000 cycles, whereas the OER overpotential of a bare nickel electrode increased within only 200 cycles. The beta-FeOOH nanorod efficiently suppressed the corrosion of the nickel substrate and the layer of beta-FeOOH nanorod was continuously repaired by accumulating the beta-FeOOH nanorod from the electrolyte. Therefore, the beta-FeOOH nanorod is useful as a self-repairing anode catalyst with high OER activity and durability.

AB  - In alkaline water electrolysis, reverse currents are reported to occur after rapid cell voltage change due to the electrodes oxidation state difference and such currents lead to electrodes degradation. The reverse current problems can be more severe in practical applications with larger electrode sizes and larger numbers of cells. In this study, reverse current with changes in the oxidation state of electrodes and potential distribution aftersudden shutdown were analyzed based on a multi-physical simulation considering an electronic and ionic conduction in practical-scale. The effects of stack height, number of cells, and ionic resistance through the manifold on the reverse current distribution were investigated. The numerical results reveal that, especially under the condition of low manifold resistance and higher stack height, the discharge current extremely concentrated near the bottom of the edge electrode. This information is important for future stack development because this current concentration can cause severe stack degradation. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) play a pivotal role in the realm of large-scale hydrogen production. However, AWEs face significant challenges in electrode degradation particularly under dynamic operating conditions, induced by reverse current phenomenon during frequent startup/shutdown. Herein, this study aims to rationalize the degradation mechanisms of AWEs under these conditions. A three-electrode membrane electrode assembly (MEA) setup is first utilized to decouple polarization behaviors of anode and cathode in AWEs. Following a proposed accelerated stress testing protocol, the setup allows for tracking individual electrode performance transformations during frequent reverse current operation. Integrating operando cell studies with in situ and post-mortem characterizations, it is showed that continuous formation of highly active species, nickel (oxy)hydroxides, improves the anode performance for oxygen evolution reaction. On the contrary, irreversible oxidation of nickel to beta-nickel hydroxide results in a severe degradation of cathode, leading to material dissolution, poor electrical conductivity and loss of catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. These results provide insights in nickel-based electrode transformation mechanisms for alkaline water electrolysis and indicate that cathode with higher redox reversibility can potentially improve durability of AWEs under dynamic conditions.

AB  - In the bipolar-type alkaline water electrolysis powered by renewable energy, electrocatalysts are degraded by repeated potential change associated with the generation of reverse current. If an electrode has large discharge capacity, the opposite electrode on the same bipolar plate is degraded by the reverse current. In this study, discharge capacity of various transition metal-based electrocatalysts was investigated to clarify the determining factors of electrocatalysts on the reverse current and durability. The discharge capacities from 1.5 to 0.5 V vs. RHE (Q(dc,0.5)) of electrocatalysts are proportional to the surface area in most cases. The proportionality coefficient, corresponding to the specific capacity, is 1.0 C & BULL;m(-2) for Co3O4 and 2.3 C & BULL;m(-2) for manganese-based electrocatalysts. The substitution of Co3+ in Co3O4 with Ni3+ increased Q(dc,0.5). The upper limit of theoretical specific capacity for Co3O4 is estimated to be 1.699 C & BULL;m(-2), meaning the former and latter cases correspond to 2- and 1-electron reactions, respectively, per a cation at the surface. The discharge capacities of the elctrocatalysts increased because of the dissolution and recrystallization of nickel and/or cobalt into metal hydroxides. The increase in the capacities of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 during ten charge-discharge cycles was below 2-9% and 0.5-38%, respectively. Therefore, if a cathode electrocatalyst with relatively low redox durability is used on the one side of a bipolar plate, it is necessary to control optimum discharge capacity of the anode by changing surface area and constituent metal cations to minimize the generation of reverse current.

AB  - Currently, tungsten mining procedures discharge a large amount of alkali wastewater, necessitating the development of sustainable approaches to valorise valuable bases for further utilization. In this study, diffusion dialysis (DD) and selective electrodialysis (SED) were utilized to recycle the alkali from a simulated tungsten leaching solution; the recycling base was further subjected to anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) for H-2 production. The results indicate that DD is capable of recycling 0.447 mol/L NaOH base with negligible leakage of WO42-, while the SED process enables the recycling of 1.63-2.01 mol/L NaOH but contains 0.11-0.14 mol/L WO42-. The AEMWE experiment showed that the water electrolyser with SED recycling alkali had a current density of 580.26 mA.cm(-2) at 1.8 V, which is much greater than 374.16 mA.cm(-2) with DD treatment solution and 352.81 mA.cm(-2) without any treatment. The WO42- impurities could adsorb on the surface of the catalyst, which further occupied the catalytic active site of the electrode catalyst and reduced the active specific surface area of the catalyst. This work demonstrated the ability of the SED and DD approaches to recycle alkali for hydrogen production, creating a new pathway for the valorisation of alkali from the tungsten mining industry.

AB  - Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of bifunctional nickel cobalt selenide@nickel telluride (NixCo12-xSe@NiTe) core-shell heterostructures via an electrodeposition approach for overall urea electrolysis and supercapacitors. The 3D vertically orientated NiTe dendritic frameworks induce the homogeneous nucleation of 2D NixCo12-xSe nanosheet arrays along similar crystal directions and bring a strong interfacial binding between the integrated active components. In particular, the optimized Ni6Co6Se@NiTe with an interface coupling effect works in concert to tune the intrinsic activity. It only needs a low overpotential of 1.33 V to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for alkaline urea electrolysis. Meanwhile, the full urea catalysis driven only by Ni6Co6Se@NiTe achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.38 V and can approach a constant level of the current response for 40 h. Besides, the integrated Ni6Co6Se@NiTe electrode delivers an enhanced specific capacity (223 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) with a high cycling stability. Consequently, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (HASC) device based on Ni6Co6Se@NiTe exhibits a favorable rate capability and reaches a high energy density of 67.7 Wh kg(-1) and a power density of 724.8 W kg(-1) with an exceptional capacity retention of 92.4% after sequential 12 000 cycles at 5 A g(-1).

AB  - In this study, a high-efficiency hybrid catalyst of Ni nanoparticles-encapsulated carbon nanotubes-bridged molybdenum carbide/nickel phosphide heterostructures (Ni@CNTs-MoxC/Ni2P) is prepared via a facile synthesis route. The catalyst having hierarchical structure with rich heterogeneous interfaces of MoxC/Ni2P micro-pillars bridged with Ni@CNTs offers an efficient connection among different active phases to guarantee good conductivity and stability. It also results in large electroactive surface with abundant multiple electroactive sites and creates unique modified electronic properties to effectively increase density of states near the Femi level and well adjust adsorption free energy, thus highly beneficial to simultaneously promote bifunctional OER and HER performances. The Ni@CNTs-MoxC/Ni2P only requires small overpotentials of 54 mV for HER and 228 for OER at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolyte, superior to recently reported bifunctional catalysts. The electrolyzer cell of Ni@CNTs-MoxC/Ni2P(+,-) requires a low operating voltage of 1.53 and 1.56 V at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline freshwater and natural seawater, respectively. The Mg/seawater battery from Ni@CNTs-MoxC/Ni2P-based cathode exhibits a high peak power density of 7.01 mW cm-2 with a stable discharge period of 100 h. The results suggest that Ni@CNTs-MoxC/Ni2P is a promising candidate for future seawater splitting and prospective Mg/ seawater battery application.

AB  - Achieving stable and efficient alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) under fluctuating renewable energy inputs is essential for large-scale green hydrogen production. However, frequent shutdown-induced reverse current (RC) effects pose significant challenges to electrode durability. Here, we introduce a gradient interlayer engineering strategy to develop robust AWE electrodes that intrinsically resist both electrochemical reconstruction and mechanical fatigue. By constructing a dense interlayer with Ni(112)/Ni3S2(120) heterointerfaces, the electrode demonstrates high catalytic activity (1.79 V @1000 mA cm(-2)& horbar;meeting the U.S. DOE 2026 target), excellent operational stability (>1500 h at 1000 mA cm(-2) in 30 wt % KOH at 80 degrees C), and exceptional RC resistance for 3600 accelerated startup/shutdown cycles. Mechanistic studies through cross-sectional characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the seamless interlayer at the catalyst-substrate interface enhances interfacial adhesion, mitigates lattice mismatch, and facilitates charge redistribution, ensuring robust stability and integrity even under operational strains and potential reversals. This work establishes interface crystallography as a design paradigm for durable electrodes, potentially overcoming the stability-activity dilemma toward industrially relevant electrolyzers coupled with fluctuating renewable energy sources.

AB  - Compared with conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER)-paired electrolysis for hydrogen production, ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR)-paired alkaline electrolysis offers enhanced energy efficiency and reduced costs. AOR-paired electrolysis offers a lower theoretical voltage (0.06 V) compared to the OER (1.23 V), enhancing thermodynamic favorability owing to its lower theoretical voltage requirements but faces stability and performance challenges. However, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication and operational parameter optimization research related to catalyst material development for AOR-paired systems is lacking. In this study, the cell assembly factors, including gasket thickness, compression forces, thermal conditions, and membrane selection, are analyzed, and the electrolyte concentration and electrochemical operating range are optimized for enhanced AOR-paired alkaline electrolysis performance. The optimal gasket thickness and assembly pressure improve the electrical conductivity and reduce the contact resistance. Higher-temperature operation and appropriate anion-exchange membrane screening enhance the ionic conductivity and reaction kinetics. The optimized KOH/NH4OH electrolyte concentration minimizes catalyst poisoning while maintaining high catalytic activity. Strategic potential window optimization mitigates irreversible surface poisoning while enabling catalyst recovery. Pulsed current protocols eliminate the reverse current phenomenon and electrode degradation by using cyclic voltammetry methods. These integrated optimization strategies enhance the current density performance, demonstrating the viability of AOR-paired electrolysis for practical hydrogen production applications.

AB  - In this paper, NiMo coatings were electrochemically deposited on a copper electrode (Cu/NiMo) and on an electrodeposited nickel onto copper plate (Cu/Ni/NiMo) in citrate solutions. Effects of electrolyte composition, pH value, and temperature on hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) as well as the electrochemical stability in alkaline solution were investigated, and the electrochemical activation energy was determined for the NiMo alloys. This was evaluated by the determination of kinetic and mechanism of HER in alkali medium by the polarization measurements, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The morphology and chemical composition of the electrodeposited Ni-Mo were investigated using SEM and EDS analyses. The results showed that the corresponding HER overpotential of the Ni-Mo film depends on alloy composition and surface morphology. As the wt% of Mo content in the alloy is increased, the onset potential of electrode for HER shifted in the positive direction favoring hydrogen generation with lower overpotential. The overall experimental data indicated that the porous Ni-Mo coating on electrodeposited nickel plate was obtained when the molybdenum content was ca. 41 wt%. This electrodes exhibited high catalytic activity in the HER (eta (100) = -48 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and 80 A degrees C), and their stability was tested by polarization measurements after different anodic and cathodic treatments in 1 M NaOH solution. Moreover, the corrosion behaviors of Ni and Cu/Ni/NiMo electrodes at open-circuit potential were also investigated, and their corrosion resistances were compared.

AB  - In this study, Ni-Mo alloy coatings were electrochemically deposited on a copper plate in citrate solutions. The effects of Ni/Mo mole ratio in the electrolyte and pH value on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as the electrochemical stability were investigated in the alkaline solution for electrodeposited NiMo. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated NiMo alloys for HER in alkaline solutions was investigated by the polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The morphology and chemical composition of the electrodeposited Ni-Mo were investigated using SEM and EDS analyses. It was found that NiMo electrode with the highest molybdenum content (ca. 38 wt.%) and high surface area show high electrocatalytic activity in the HER. This was produced from a bath with a pH of 9.5, Ni/Mo ratio of 1/10 and 0.5 M sodium citrate concentration. The stability of this coating was tested by polarization measurements after different anodic and cathodic treatment in 1 M NaOH solution. The open circuit potential (E-ocp) of the electrode as a function of immersion time was also measured.

AB  - Two-step water electrolysis has been proposed to tackle the ticklish H2/O2 mixture problems in conventional alkaline water electrolysis recently. However, low buffering capacity of pure nickel hydroxide electrode as redox mediator limited practical application of two-step water electrolysis system. A high-capacity redox mediator (RM) is urgently needed to permit consecutive operation of two-step cycles and high-efficiency hydrogen evo-lution. Consequently, a high mass-loading cobalt-doped nickel hydroxide/active carbon cloth (NiCo-LDH/ACC) RM is synthesized via a facile electrochemical method. The proper Co doping can apparently enhance the conductivity and simultaneously remain the high-capacity of the electrode. Density functional theory results further confirms more negative values in redox potential of NiCo-LDH/ACC than Ni(OH)2/ACC on account of the charge redistribution induced by Co doping, which can prevent the parasitic O2 evolution on RM electrode during decoupled H2 evolution step. As a result, the NiCo-LDH/ACC combined the superiorities of high-capacity Ni(OH)2/ACC and high-conductivity Co(OH)2/ACC, and the NiCo-LDH/ACC with 4:1 ratio of Ni to Co presented a large specific capacitance of 33.52F/cm2 for reversible charge-discharge and high buffering capacity with two-step H2/O2 evolution duration of 1740 s at 10 mA/cm2. The necessary input voltage (2.00 V) of the whole water electrolysis was broken into two smaller ones, 1.41 and 0.38 V, for H2 and O2 production, respectively. NiCoLDH/ACC provided a favorable electrode material for the practical application of two-step water electrolysis system.

AB  - One of the major challenges facing the coupling of alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE) and inherently intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) is the reverse current phenomenon that takes place after shutdown and adversely affects the service life of the electrocatalysts. Herein, this phenomenon was studied experimentally and theoretically. The study showed that the potential of the electrodes on either side of the bipolar plate (BP) changes according to the amount of the reverse charge flowing through the BP during shutdown. In addition, the potential of the electrodes of the middle BP changed relatively faster than that of the other BPs due to the increased reverse current of the middle BP. Moreover, effects of the operating parameters and electrode materials on the reverse current phenomenon are uncovered. The electrolyte circulation during shutdown as well as the high operating temperature increased the reverse current. However, the electrolysis current did not significantly affect the reverse current. Additionally, the origin of the reverse current is mainly the redox reactions of the electrodes during shutdown. Furthermore, the cathode that attached to a robust anode, on the same BP, is subject to more stressors. This study is useful for adapting the AWE to the dynamic operation.

AB  - There is a strong desire to replace bulk nickel electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a cheaper and more active steel material in alkaline water electrolyser (AWE). However, implementing an activation procedure to optimize the steel electrode surface is necessary. In this work, we activated 316 stainless steel (SS316) in KOH electrolytes of increasing concentration by applying an optimized potential of +1.70 V vs RHE for 18 hours. The electrocatalytic activity increased significantly with increasing the KOH concentration of the activation electrolyte, which is linked to a beneficial change in the surface composition during activation. The surface was analysed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). XPS showed an increasing Ni content (41% to 73%) in the surface with simultaneous removal of Cr (3.4% to 0%) and Fe (55% to 27%) with increasing KOH concentration of the activation electrolyte. Activation in minimum 7.5 M KOH gave the best performing OER electrode with an electrode potential (E) of +1.525 V vs. RHE at a current density (j) of 10 mA cm-2. Tafel slopes of around 40 mV dec-1 were found for all activated samples, indicating the same OER mechanism independent of the resulting surface composition. Reaction orders of 1.5 and 1.3 were found in the low and high potential regions, respectively. A negligible performance change was observed for the activated electrodes over a 48 h test at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH. This work shows that the electrochemical activation of 316 stainless steel in high pH KOH electrolytes improves the OER activity significantly and that the surface composition can be tailored with KOH concentration up to 73% Ni. Through optimizing the surface composition, steel materials offer a cost-effective alternative to bulk nickel electrodes as OER electrodes in commercial AWE.

AB  - The substantial cost reductions in renewable energy sources (RES), particularly solar and wind, could facilitate their large-scale integration into modern power systems, thereby accelerating the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. However, the inherent intermittency of RES highlights the critical need for efficient energy storage technologies, with green hydrogen emerging as a promising and sustainable energy carrier. Alkaline water electrolysis offers a scalable and cost-effective solution; however, ensuring the long-term durability of electrodes under dynamic operation remains a critical challenge. In this study, the durability of NiCoO x OER catalysts was evaluated using two accelerated degradation test (ADT) protocols: a conventional cyclic voltammetry (CV-ADT) protocol and a start-up/shut-down protocol. The latter was specifically designed to simulate the operational characteristics of (RES)-driven systems, including the effects of reverse current phenomenon typically observed in bipolar plate AWE stacks. This protocol imposed more severe stressors on the electrodes than the CV-ADT protocol, most likely providing a more realistic simulation of the intermittent conditions encountered in RES-based operation. Electrochemical measurements, along with operando and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, provided insights into the OER active sites and the degradation mechanisms of the catalyst under repeated start-up/shut-down ADT cycles. The results suggested that cobalt leaching at and beneath the electrode/electrolyte interface is a likely key factor contributing to catalyst detachment from the substrate.

AB  - The interchangeable operation of alkaline oxygen evolution and reduction using bifunctional electrocatalysts in devices consolidates the commercialization milestone of energy storage in hydrogen, and yet, it is usually limited by issues of carbon corrosion in electrocatalysts and inhomogeneous electrode fabrication. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic route toward carbon-free ternary rock salt oxide (i.e., NiO/CoO/FeO) hollow spheres with silver decoration on the surface for durable operation in bifunctional cells. These Ag-decorated ternary oxides exhibit an overall bifunctional potential gap (Delta E = E-j10(,) (OER) - E-jh(alf,) (ORR)) of 0.89 V. Operando Raman studies show that the rock salt structure shows the phenomenon of a highly reversible local environment during the charge-discharge OER cycles, a key characteristic for high durability in bifunctional devices. At equivalent content between Ni and Co, NiOOH is the main OER-active species with CoOOH and/or CoO2 as the cocatalyst, where the presence of the FeO dopant facilitates structural activation and reversibility. With the proof-of-concept performance in anion-exchange membrane (AEM) devices, the catalysts achieve a durable cyclic operation with a high current density (1000 mA cm(-2)) at smaller potentials (2.03 V) than RuO2 (2.16 V) under the electrolyzer mode, while it can yield two times greater power density (96.98 mW cm(-2)) than Pt/C (S3.58 mW cm(-2)) in the fuel cell mode.

AB  - Background: This study examines the vertically aligned Y2O3-doped ZnO-C-N nanorods with a nickel foam electrode as the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Y2O3-doped ZnO-C-N nanorods have not been used for the water electrolysis application. Methods: The Y2O3-doped ZnO-C-N nanomaterials were synthesized using a sol-gel method. Subsequently, the electrode materials were fabricated via the slurry coating technique for AEMWEs applications. Significant findings: Through various characterization techniques, the Y2O3-doped ZnO-C-N nanorods with the nickel foam electrode demonstrated superior OER activity compared to the ZnO-C-N nanoflower with the same electrode, exhibiting a higher current density. SEM analysis confirms the nanoflower and nanorod structures of ZnO-C-N and Y2O3-doped ZnO-C-N, respectively. XRD analysis verified the presence of a hexagonal wurtzite structure and a cubic structure of ZnO and Y2O3, respectively, in all synthesized samples. Additionally, an investigation into the effects of Y2O3 impurities in ZnO-C-N on electrochemical properties revealed their influence on OER performance with lower overpotential (380 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and Tafel slope of 94.35 mV/dec. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the vertically aligned nanorod microstructure, which facilitates electron transport and ion diffusion during repeated charge/discharge cycles. This study underscores the importance of hydrogen generation and highlights the role of AEMs utilizing non-noble metal catalysts at reduced costs.

AB  - In this work, innovative use of Salinity Gradient Power (SGP) as renewable energy source for indirect production of hydrogen is addressed. A lab-scale reverse electrodialysis (RED) unit, fed with different NaCl solutions mimicking highly concentrated brine (5 M), Reverse Osmosis retentate (1 M), seawater (0.5 M) and brackish water (0.1 M), was coupled to an alkaline polymer electrolyte (APE) water electrolysis cell. SGP-RED unit, equipped with 27 cell-pairs, reached at best an Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) of 3.7 V and maximum gross power density of 3.2 W m(MP)(2) (membrane pair) when feeding the low concentration compartment (LCC) with 0.1 M NaCl and the High Concentration Compartment (HCC) with 5 M NaCl. The single-cell APE water electrolysis unit, operated at 1.8 V, attained a current density of 120 mA cm(-2) under the following configuration: 10% w/w KOH electrolyte, highly conductive anion selective membrane composed of inert low-density polyethylene, finely milled anion selective particles and water-soluble poly (ethylene glycol-ran-propylene glycol), non-Platinum catalysts (NiCo2O4 and NiFe2O4) loading of 10 mg cm(-2) and 15%w/w polymer binder at both cathode and anode, and operational temperature of 65 degrees C. The integrated system resulted in a maximum hydrogen production rate of 44 cm(3) h(-1) per cm(2) of electrode surface area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nanoscale fl-Ni(OH)2 is considered to be one of the most promising electrode material for supercapacitors because of its low cost, long cycle life and high theoretical capacitance. However, its preparation often involves either high temperatures or the use of complicated alkaline system, water-soluble precursors and surfactants, which greatly restrict its development. In this paper, a 3D flower-like fl-Ni(OH)2 microsphere was successfully fabricated at 500 V discharge voltage in NaCl electrolyte solution with adding a certain amount of CH3COONa as stabilizer via cathode glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) plasma, in which Pt needle and Ni foil were acted as cathode and anode, respectively. The results of FT-IR, XRD, Raman and XPS demonstrated that the hexagonal phase fl-Ni(OH)2 with structural defects is produced during the CGDE process. Morphological analysis by SEM, TEM and AFM revealed that fl-Ni(OH)2 exhibits a 3D flower-like microsphere with a diameter of about 1-3 mu m, which is assembled by dozens of -3.0 nm thick nanosheets. The specific surface area and average pore-size of the flower-like beta-Ni(OH)2 microspheres are 184.9 m2 g-1 and 17.8 nm, respectively. A possible formation mechanism is proposed on the basis of Ostwald ripening. fl-Ni(OH)2 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1818 F g-1 at 3 A g-1 and good capacity retention of 85 % after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at current density of 5 A g-1. 3D flower-like beta-Ni(OH)2 microsphere can be used as a highly promising candidate for the supercapacitor electrodes.

AB  - The behavior of the leak and reverse currents in a bipolar-type alkaline water electrolyzer has been investigated using a bipolar-type electrolyzer which consists of two cells. The electrodes were nickel mesh, which are the conventional electrodes for alkaline water electrolyzers. The leak circuit could be expressed by a simple equation and a simple equivalent circuit for the cell performance and ionic resistance of the manifolds. The electrolyte was replaced by a gas-free electrolyte after electrolysis to classify the influence of the reverse current into the gas reaction and electrode active material. As a result, the dominant driving force of the reverse current was the active nickel-based materials on the Ni electrode. The redox couples on the electrode surface during the reverse current were estimated based on the measured cell voltages and redox potentials on a nickel electrode. The final potentials of both sides on the bipolar plate for the replacement conditions were higher than those for the non-replacement condition, because the hydrogen of the reductant was removed from the cathode electrolyte, and the balance of the reductant and oxidant would change to the oxidation side.

AB  - Raney Ni (R-Ni) electrodes are used as hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts in alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). However, they are not durable because of reverse current-induced oxidation and catalyst damage from H-2 bubbles. Reverse current triggers Ni phase changes and mechanical stress, leading to catalyst delamination, while bubbles block active sites, increase resistance, and cause structural damage. These issues have been addressed individually but not simultaneously. In this study, a P-doped Ni (NiP) protective layer is electroplated on the R-Ni electrode to overcome both challenges. The NiP protective layer inhibits oxidation, reducing Ni phase changes and preventing catalyst delamination. Enhanced surface wettability minimizes nucleation and facilitates faster bubble detachment, reducing bubble-related damage. Electrochemical tests reveal that NiP/R-Ni exhibits a 26 mV lower overpotential than that of R-Ni at -400 mA cm(-2), indicating higher catalytic activity. Accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) demonstrate the retention of the NiP/R-Ni catalyst layer, with only a 25 mV increase in overpotential after ADT, which is significantly less than that of R-Ni. Real-time impedance analysis reveals the presence of small, rapidly detaching bubbles on NiP/R-Ni. Overall, the NiP protective layer on R-Ni simultaneously mitigates both reverse current and H-2 bubble-induced degradation, improving catalytic activity and durability during AWE.

AB  - A reverse current obtained during power shutdowns in industrial processes, such as chlor-alkali production or alkaline water electrolysis, is deleterious for hydrogen evolving ruthenium dioxide (Ru02) based cathodes. It has been observed that RuO2 coatings after a power shutdown, necessary for e.g. maintenance, are severely damaged unless polarization rectifiers are employed. In this work we show why these types of cathodes are sensitive to reverse currents, i.e. anodic currents, after hydrogen evolution. RuO2 coatings deposited on nickel substrates were subjected to different electrochemical treatments such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, or reverse currents in 8 M NaOH at 90 degrees C. Polarity inversion was introduced after hydrogen evolution to simulate the effect of reverse currents. Because of chemical interaction with hydrogen, a significant amount of the RuO2 coating was transformed into hydroxylated species during cathodic polarization. Our study shows that these hydroxylated phases are highly sensitive to electrochemical corrosion during anodic polarization after extended hydrogen evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work studies the durability of Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysers by applying an Accelerated Stress Test (AST) protocol to two different membrane configurations: the standard Fumasep (R) FM-FAA-3-50 and the reinforced Fumasep (R) FM-FAA-PK-3-75, which incorporates a polyether ketone (PK) matrix for increased mechanical stability. Although AEMWEs are emerging as a promising and cost-effective technology for hydrogen production, their limited durability remains a major barrier to large-scale deployment, with degradation processes not fully understood. Therefore, a comprehensive characterisation of the cell and its components was performed, combining mechanical and chemical analyses (SEM-EDS), electrolyte ion chromatography and electrochemical methods (VI curves, EIS spectra). Durability tests, consisting of 192 h AST protocol, revealed, after an initial break-in phase, a gradual increase in cell voltage during prolonged operation (0.58-0.63 mV/h at nominal current) attributed to structural and functional degradation of both the membranes and electrodes. The main degradation mechanisms identified include the loss of cationic functional groups due to OH- attack, catalyst dissolution and agglomeration, along with progressive deterioration of the membrane-electrode assembly. The intermittent operation introduced by the AST protocol further aggravated the decline in performance, with periods of shutdown leading to membrane dehydration and gas stagnation, resulting in increased ohmic resistance and hindered interfacial kinetics (up to +19 % and +18 % in ohmic and polarization resistances, respectively). Periodic replacement of the electrolyte allowed partial recovery of cell performance, mitigating reversible losses (up to -18 % in ohmic resistance). To ensure the long-term viability of AEMWE, the improvement of both the chemical and mechanical stability of membranes is necessary, thereby enabling sustainable and efficient hydrogen production under real operating conditions.

AB  - This work presents a novel approach combining reverse electrodialysis (RED) and alkaline polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (APWEL) for renewable hydrogen production. APWEL is fuelled by salinity gradient power (SGP) extracted from sulfate (SO42-)-rich industrial wastewater. The performance of a pilot-scale RED unit (200 cells, active area: 31.5 x 63.5 cm(2)), using salt solutions mimicking sulfate -rich waste streams (0.01-0.3 M Na2SO4), was evaluated. An open circuit voltage (OCV) of 12.3 V, a maximum power density of 0.22 W/m(2)MP (MP: membrane pair) and internal area resistance of 43.2 Omega cm(2)/cell were recorded by using 0.01 M/0.3 M Na2SO4 solutions at 35 degrees C. The APWEL stack (6 cells, active area: 5 x 5 cm(2)), equipped with Ni foam electrodes and heterogeneous anion-selective membranes, was tested with varying concentrations of liquid electrolyte (0.85-2.5 M KOH) and varying temperatures (28-48 degrees C). The APWEL stack attained a maximum current density of 110 mA/m(2) at 1.85 V/cell (i.e. 11 V per stack), 2.5 M KOH and 48 C. Under these conditions, the integrated system exhibited a maximum hydrogen production rate of 50 cm(3)/h-cm(2). This study opens up a new perspective on renewable hydrogen production fuelled by non -intermittent SGP from SO42--rich industrial effluents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we describe the green plasma electrolysis of a magnesium alloy in alkaline electrolyte to produce a hybrid inorganic layer with nickel (hydr) oxide incorporated in a matrix of magnesium oxide, and investigate the electrochemical and optical properties of this material. The addition of Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O to the electrolyte reduced the size of the micro-defects found in the inorganic layer after plasma electrolysis by inducing soft plasma discharges. As a result, through cyclic voltammetry and polarization tests, the corrosion stability of the sample containing nickel (hydr) oxide was significantly enhanced. Measurement of the optical properties reveals that the material possesses excellent energy efficiency as indicated by a high solar absorptivity of similar to 0.92 and a low infrared emissivity of similar to 0.13 which are presumably due to the inherent dark-brown colour of nickel (hydr) oxide. We expect that these results will have implications in the development of functional materials with excellent optical and corrosion properties by considering green processing utilizing alkaline electrolyte.

AB  - Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), as a premier technology to massively produce green hydrogen, hinges on outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes with high activity and robust stability under high current densities. However, it is often challenged by issues such as catalytic layer shedding, ion dissolution, and inefficient bubble desorption. Herein, a scalable corrosion-electrodeposition method is presented to synthesize nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH)/Ni3S2 heterostructures on nickel mesh, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of industrial AWE. The study underscores the critical role of the built-in electric field (BEF) in optimizing electronic properties, curtailing Fe leaching, and enhancing mass transfer. The resultant NiFe-LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure manifests remarkable OER performance, with ultra-low overpotentials of 202 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 290 mV at 800 mA cm-2 in 1.0 m KOH at 25 degrees C, alongside superior steady-state stability and resistance to reverse current under fluctuating conditions. Furthermore, the performance is further validated in an alkaline electrolyzer, achieving a large current density of 800 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.908 V, while maintaining excellent stability. This work offers a blueprint for the design of efficient OER electrodes for industrially relevant AWE applications.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
LA  - English
AB  - Decoupled water electrolysis is a feasible technique for the large-scale production of high-purity H-2, in which heteropolyacids are attractive electron-coupled proton buffers. An aqueous Zn-phosphomolybdic acid battery is designed for the simultaneous generation of reduced phosphomolybdic acid and electricity. The reported Zn-phosphomolybdic acid battery possesses an open circuit voltage of similar to 1.50 V, and the coulombic efficiency of the Zn-phosphomolybdic acid battery can remain at a high level (>90%). Furthermore, the reduced phosphomolybdic acid can be used as an active electron-coupled proton buffer for efficient decoupled hydrogen production from alkaline water electrolysis in the presence of highly dispersed ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (similar to 2.0 nm) on nickel-cobalt hydroxide nanosheets at a low Pt loading (0.4 mg cm(-2)) as a free-standing electrode.

AB  - Anion exchange membrane (AEM)-based electrolysis for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered attention as a promising carbon dioxide utilization technology due to its superior energy efficiency at high current densities. The major drawback of AEM-based electrolysis for CO2RR is CO2 crossover, which leads to the loss of introduced CO2 feedstock and thus detrimentally affects the process's overall economic and environmental viability. We design a 3-stage membrane-based CO2 recovery unit to capture CO2 from the mixture of CO2 and O-2 discharged from the anode side of AEM-based CO2 electrolyzers. The membrane area is optimized via a hybrid of genetic algorithm and 'fmincon' in MATLAB. The estimated CO2 capture cost ranges from 43.3 to 109.3 USD/tCO(2), which is economically comparable to piperazine-based amine scrubbing units when recovering CO2 at a purity of up to 99.5 mol.% under a CO2/O-2 molar ratio of 1.5 similar to 2. The carbon footprint of the designed process ranges from -0.936 to -0.838 tCO(2)eq/tCO(2)-captured, indicating superior environmental performance compared to those of the piperazine-based amine scrubbing units.

AB  - Hierarchical bimetallic Ni-Co phosphides hollow spheres were encapsulated in P-doped reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) to provide superior electrochemistry performances. The hollow spheres with controlling Co/Ni ratios were obtained via a hydrothermal process and following phosphorization reaction using Ni-Co based glycerate microsphere as a self-sacrificing template. The hollow shell with vertical branches was formed via a morphology evolution of solid, yolk-shell to hollow. The hollow spheres were encapsulated in PrGO networks by a hydrothermal synthesis and phosphorization process to fabricate PrGO/Ni-Co phosphide composite (PrGO/NiCoP). Because of unique morphology and composition, the composite with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:1 exhibits enhanced supercapacitor and electrocatalysis properties. As a supercapacitor electrode, PrGO/NiCoP provides high discharge specific capacity, excellent rate performance and cycle stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with PrGO/NiCoP and activated carbon possesses an energy density of 49.7 Wh/Kg with power density of 0.366 kW/kg, which can successfully illuminate red-light light emitting diode. As an electrocatalyst, PrGO/NiCoP exhibits high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activities in 1M KOH electrolyte. PrGO/NiCoP electrolyzer shows excellent overall water splitting performance and durability, which required a cell voltage of 1.56 V to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A large amount of urea-containing wastewater is produced as a by-product in the fertilizer industry, requiring costly and complicated treatment strategies. Considering that urea can be exploited as fuel, this wastewater can be treated and simultaneously exploited as a renewable energy source in a direct urea fuel cell. In this study, multi-layers graphene/nickel nanocomposites were prepared by a one-step green method for use as an anode in the direct urea fuel cell. Typically, commercial sugar was mixed with nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate in distilled water and then calcined at 800 degrees C for 1 h. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the final product. The results confirmed the formation of multi-layers graphene sheets decorated by nickel nanoparticles. To investigate the influence of metal nanoparticles content, samples were prepared using different amounts of the metal precursor; nickel acetate content was changed from 0 to 5 wt.%. Investigation of the electrochemical characterizations indicated that the sample prepared using the original solution with 3 wt.% nickel acetate had the best current density, 81.65 mA/cm(2) in a 0.33 M urea solution (in 1 M KOH) at an applied voltage 0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl. In a passive direct urea fuel cell based on the optimal composition, the observed maximum power density was 4.06 x 10(-3) mW/cm(2) with an open circuit voltage of 0.197 V at room temperature in an actual electric circuit.

AB  - Iron (Fe) contamination in potassium hydroxide (KOH) poses a significant challenge for the reliability of membrane based alkaline electrolysis systems (AEMWE) due to its influence on electrocatalytic behaviour and system stability. The dissolution of Fe from cell components or as an electrolyte impurity can affect membrane resistivity, produce short circuit pathways, and result in anomalous deposition within the system. The objective of this study is to compare various benchmark purification methods and develop a simple, effective, and accelerated protocol for Fe removal using a 3 electrode Pt-mesh setup. Fe residues in KOH were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) over a 24-h pre-electrolysis period. The results indicated that Fe levels dropped significantly within the first two hours of pre-electrolysis. By combining acid washing and holding at open-circuit potential (OCP) in Fe-free KOH, Pt mesh was shown to be capable of reducing Fe levels in contaminated KOH solutions to near-zero levels within 2 h.

AB  - Long-term durability of Ni-based electrodes under renewable energy (RE) driven dynamic operation, remains a critical bottleneck in advancing the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). Among various durability-related failure behaviors, degradation induced by reverse current (RC) has been largely overlooked, despite its growing relevance under fluctuating RE. Herein, we systematically elucidate a multistage degradation pathway of Ni-Ru electrodes (NR) under an accelerated stress test (AST). By combining full-process electrochemical monitoring with morphological and compositional analysis the pathway is summarized as follow: (i) the dense Ru layer is initially oxidated into rough and defective surface with high surface area, under the Ostwald ripening effect; (ii) promoted by the gradual formation of the Ni-Ru co-exposure to the electrolyte, the Ni substrate is subsequently galvanic corroded accompanied by partial Ru redeposition; (iii) through prolonged operation, both Ni and Ru are extensively oxidated and precipitated, eventually resulting in complete Ru depletion and structural collapse of Ni substrate. Based on this mechanistic understanding, we further investigate the effect of RC amplitude on degradation kinetics. Reducing the RC amplitude fraction from 20% to 0%, the initial Ru oxidation is effectively suppressed and following failure is thereby mitigated, with decreasing the degradation rate from 4.756 to 0.257 mV h-1. These findings provide with fundamental insight into dynamic degradation evolution and offer practical mechanism for RC-tolerant electrode design.

AB  - A hydroxide-conducting polymer, HMT-PMBI, which is prepared by methylation of poly[2,2'-(2,2 '',4,4 '',6,6 ''-hexamethyl- p-terphenyl-3,3 ''-diyl)-5,5 '-bibenzimidazole] (HMT-PBI), is utilized as both the polymer electrolyte membrane and ionomer in an alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cell and alkaline polymer electrolyzer. A fuel cell operating between 60 and 90 degrees C and subjected to operational shutdown, restarts, and CO2-containing air demonstrates remarkable in situ stability for >4 days, over which its performance improved. An HMT-PMBI-based fuel cell was operated at current densities >1000 mA cm(-2) and power densities of 370 mW cm(-2) at 60 degrees C. When similarly operated in a water electrolyzer with circulating 1 M KOH electrolyte at 60 degrees C, its performance was unchanged after 8 days of operation. Methodology for up-scaled synthesis of HMT-PMBI is presented, wherein >1/2 kg is synthesized in six steps with a yield of 42%. Each step is optimized to achieve high batch-to-batch reproducibility. Water uptake, dimensional swelling, and ionic conductivity of HMT-PMBI membranes exchanged with various anions are reported. In the fully-hydrated chloride form, HMT-PMBI membranes are mechanically strong, and possess a tensile strength and Young's modulus of 33 MPa and 225 MPa, respectively, which are significantly higher than Nafion 212, for example. The hydroxide anion form shows remarkable ex situ chemical and mechanical stability and is seemingly unchanged after a 7 days exposure to 1 M NaOH at 80 degrees C or 6 M NaOH at 25 degrees C. Only 6% chemical degradation is observed when exposed to 2 M NaOH at 80 degrees C for 7 days. The ease of synthesis, synthetic reproducibility, scale-up, and exceptional in situ and ex situ properties of HMT-PMBI renders this a potential benchmark polymer for energy conversion devices requiring an anion-exchange material.

AB  - Ni, NiO, beta-Ni(OH)(2) and Pt nanomaterials are prepared with cathodic contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) in acidic and alkaline media by alternating the Ni and Pt cathode vs. a large Ni anode. The morphological and crystalline characterizations of the products suggest two reaction mechanisms where in the first, metal ions are locally reduced by the high reducing agents generated by the electrical discharges from the cathode, i.e. the solvated electron, the H-center dot radical and secondary species if any. This is supported by CGDE experiments conducted in acidic environment with Ni or Pt cathode that gave Ni-based materials only. The second mechanism for the formation of metals aggregates is due to the cathode material electro-erosion due to the high temperature spots at its surface that lead to the local vaporization of its material and the rapid quenching of the generated powder. This conclusion is drawn after eliminating the source of Ni2+ ions, initially due to the Ni anode dissolution in acidic pH, and conducting the same two previous experiments in concentrated KOH solutions instead. In both arrangements, it is the cathode material that was the source of the synthesized nanoparticles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is an ongoing challenge to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts that are highly active and able to operate in the harsh alkaline electrolyte used in commercial electrolysers. In addition, commercial units cannot be directly integrated with intermittent renewable energy sources due to rapid start up and shut down conditions which rapidly deteriorates the anode and cathode materials. Here, a very simple electrochemical conditioning approach followed by galvanic replacement with gold nanoparticles at a level of 0.5 at.% is demonstrated to transform stainless steel (AISI 316) into an electrocatalyst that facilitates overall water splitting while showing excellent tolerance to reverse polarity conditions. The electrocatalyst is not only very active for the OER with a low Tafel slope value of 29 mV dec(-1), but also shows excellent performance for the HER where high current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) can be achieved. In a two-cell configuration, current densities greater than 150mA cm(-2) can be achieved for overall water splitting in 6 M NaOH at a cell voltage of only 2 V indicating potential commercial applicability. Additionally, the electrodes demonstrate high tolerance to reversing the polarity of the cell over prolonged periods of up to 216 h where equal performance is maintained. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bipolar membranes (BPMs) are gaining interest in energy conversion technologies. These membranes are composed of cation- and anion-exchange layers, with an interfacial layer in between. This gives the freedom to operate in different conditions (pH, concentration, composition) at both sides. Such membranes are used in two operational modes, forward and reverse bias. BPMs have been implemented in various electrochemical applications, like water and CO2 electrolyzers, fuel cells, and flow batteries, while BPMs are historically designed for acid/base production. Therefore, current commercial BPMs are not optimized, as the conditions change per application. Although the ideal BPM has highly conductive layers, high water dissociation kinetics, long lifetime, and low ion crossover, each application has its own priorities to be competitive in its field. We describe the challenges and requirements for future BPMs, and identify existing developments that can be leveraged to develop BPMs toward the scale of practical applications.

AB  - Hydrogen is considered to be the most promising candidate as a future energy carrier. One of the most used technologies for the electrolytic hydrogen production is alkaline water electrolysis. However, due to the high energy requirements, the cost of hydrogen produced in such a way is high.
   In continuous search to improve this process using advanced electrocatalytic materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), high area NiCo/Zn electrodes were prepared on AISI 304 stainless steel substrates by electrodeposition. After preparing, the alloys were leached of to remove part of the zinc and generate a porous layer (type Raney electrodes). The presence of a thin Ni layer between the substrate and the Raney coating favour the adherence of the latter. The porous NiCo/Zn electrode was characterized by SEM, EDX, confocal laser microscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. HER on this electrode was evaluated in 30 wt.% KOH solution by means of polarization curves, hydrogen discharge curves, and galvanostatic tests. Results show that the developed electrode presents a most efficient behaviour for HER when comparing with the smooth Ni cathode. The high electrode activity was mainly attributed to the high surface area of the developed electrode. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Electrodes' stability under intermittent operation remains a key bottleneck for alkaline seawater electrolysis. Especially, the cathode typically undergoes self-oxidation under constant-current operation, while this process intensifies during abrupt shutdown due to the presence of reverse current. Such accelerated cathodic degradation significantly undermines the long-term durability of the electrolyzer during practical operating. Here a fluorine-doped nickel-molybdenum oxide cathode is reported that maintains stability under both constant-current operation and startup-shutdown transitions. This full-cycle stability is achieved through a vacancy-mediated molybdate trap-and-buffer strategy. Vacancies generated by fluorine leaching under constant-current operation strongly trap molybdates, forming a negatively charged interfacial layer. This electron-enriched layer effectively buffers the active sites against overoxidation during abrupt shutdown. Meanwhile, its strong electrostatic-repulsion capability suppresses further dissolving of molybdenum and protects the electrode from chloride ion attack. As a result, an alkaline seawater electrolyzer assembled with the target catalyst operates stably for over 500 h at constant-current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A cm-2. Notably, the electrolyzer maintains stable performance over 3900 startup-shutdown cycles with a minimal voltage degradation of only 0.02 mV per cycle.

AB  - The flexible operation of alkaline water electrolyzers enables power-to-x plants to react efficiently to different energy scenarios. In this work, a novel scheduling model for alkaline water electrolysis is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. The model is constructed by implementing operational states (production, standby, idle) and transitions (cold/full startup, shutdown) as integer variables, while the power loading and hydrogen flowrate are set as continuous variables. The operational characteristics (load range, startup time, ramp rates) are included as model constraints. The proposed model allows finding optimal number of electrolyzers and production schedules when dealing with large data sets of intermittent energy and electricity price. The optimal solution of the case study shows a balance between hydrogen production, energy absorption, and operation and investment costs. The optimal number of electrolyzers to be installed corresponds to 54% of the ones required to absorb the highest energy peak, being capable of loading 89.7% of the available energy during the year of operation, with an overall plant utilization of 93.7% and 764 startup/shutdown cycles evenly distributed among the units.

AB  - The development of efficient and dimensionally stable electrode plates is of a significant challenge for the oxygen evolution reaction in the industrial water electrolysis process. In this work, structurally stable electrode plates are developed based on the nanostructured Ni-Fe catalysts on highly porous and dimensionally stable Co reactive deposited on Ti substrates, Ni-Fe@Co/Ti. SEM analysis shows the hierarchically structured micro- and nano-porous structure of the Co electrode on Ti substrates by reactive deposition route. The surface area of the reactive deposited Co is 3 times larger than that of the conventional electrodeposited Co electrode, providing highly porous and stable base for the subsequent deposition of Ni-Fe electrocatalysts. The as-prepared Ni-Fe@Co/Ti electrode exhibits high catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution in alkaline solutions, achieving an onset potential of as low as 1.44 V (eta = 210 mV) and delivering a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.26 V. Most importantly, the electrode shows excellent stability with negligible degradation under the discharge current density at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h, demonstrating the practical applicability of the Ni-Fe@Co/Ti nanostructured electrodes for industrial scale water electrolysis.

AB  - Energy conversion technologies that are key to decarbonization efforts face significant durability challenges due to variable operation. Understanding the impact of variable operation on catalytic stability and identifying the key variables that dictate degradation is crucial for developing robust technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of variable operation on liquid alkaline water electrolysis. Our findings reveal that variable operation induces severe degradation of Ni, Fe, and Co catalytic films that is not observed during steady-state operation. By systematically interrogating the electrode discharge during simulated shutdown tests using Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques, we uncover significant alterations caused by reverse currents in real time. These include changes in crystal structure, composition, film thickness, electronic conductivity, and dissolution rates. Lab-scale electrolyzer experiments further highlight the impact of variable operation on catalyst materials under relevant conditions. Finally, we provide guidelines for leveraging these insights to advance electrocatalysis research. This work underscores the importance of integrating realistic stressors into stability testing and offers practical guidelines for catalyst design, performance evaluation, and industrial implementation. Collectively, insights from this study will drive the development of more resilient energy conversion technologies.

AB  - This study explores the impact of reverse current on catalyst degradation in alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems that are powered by renewable energy sources (RESs). AWE is a promising technology for green hydrogen generation, but frequent on/off cycling due to RES intermittency poses challenges, including catalyst degradation. This research focuses on two key electrocatalysts: Ru for the hydrogen evolution reaction and LaNiO3 for the oxygen evolution reaction. The stability of the catalysts was investigated under dynamic operating conditions. The experiments reveal that the redox capacitance is discharged under closed-circuit conditions, which generates a substantial shift of the applied potential in the reverse direction in both the cathode and anode. As a result, reverse current flows and affects the catalyst stability. The Ru cathode degradation was studied with anodes of varying double-layer capacitance (C dl). Porous NiRu cathodes with higher C dl values showed better balance with LaNiO3 anode, which reduced the changes in the resultant reaching electrode potential and thus mitigated degradation due to dissolution of Ru species. This study provides valuable insights for the design of stable electrode materials for AWE systems that operate under fluctuating conditions and emphasizes the importance of tuning the anode-cathode capacitance ratios to enhance durability and efficiency.

AB  - A rechargeable organic-air flow battery based on aqueous electrolytes is proposed and tests are conducted in a divided cell with a three-electrode configuration. Quinoxaline is used as the negative redox couple due to its low electrode potential of c.a. -0.9 V vs. Hg|HgO in aqueous electrolytes. High-surface-area nickel mesh and manganese-dioxide electrodes were employed for oxygen evolution and reduction, respectively, together with a low-cost hydroxide doped polybenzimidazole (m-PBI) separator (c.a. 20 m). In typical alkaline electrolytes (2 M NaOH), the open-circuit voltage of the flow battery was c.a. 0.95 V, which is comparable to existing organic-based batteries. The average charge and discharge cell voltage ranges at 5-10 mA cm(-2) were 1.7-1.95 V and 0.4-0.7 V, respectively. Despite using low-cost materials, average coulombic and energy efficiencies of the batteries were c.a. 81 and 25%, respectively, at 7.5 mA cm(-2) over 20 cycles.

AB  - The long-promised lifespan of alkaline water electrolysis is due to its stable power system. However, when used for hydrogen production with renewable energy, electrode degradation caused by an intermittent power supply must be predicted. In alkaline water electrolysis, where all cells are connected in series, intermittent shutdowns create a reverse current. This results in the reduction of anode material during the stopping time, and the repeated oxidation-reduction process due to intermittent power causes degradation. Electrodes coated with thermally decomposed electrocatalysts on a nickel substrate have demonstrated high durability in industrial alkaline electrolysis applications. However, their durability decreases when exposed to reverse currents due to the detachment of the catalyst layer. In this study, we aimed to improve durability and catalytic performance by using stepwise temperature control during the coating heat treatment and reducing the annealing duration. This two-step process formed an intermediate NiOx-rich layer between the catalyst and substrate. This might strengthen interfacial adhesion and improve the durability of the catalyst layer. However, at high temperatures, as the heat treatment time increases, the intermediate oxide layer becomes more pronounced, subsequently increasing the NiO proportion. The low electrical conductivity of NiO leads to increased resistance and decreased initial performance. The most appropriate heat treatment conditions were 300 degrees C decomposition followed by 500 degrees C annealing with a relatively short time. The performance interval, maintained at approximately 1.7 V vs. RHE, increased by about three times compared to conventional consistent heat treatment. This improvement is believed to be due to optimal formation of the catalyst structure via thermal decomposition and of the intermediate oxide layer via annealing. (c) The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - For electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a new accelerated durability test (ADT) protocol is presented. The protocol is designed to closely mimic the fluctuations of renewable energies. The unit cycle of the current ADT protocol represents the "ON/OFF" operation mode. In the "ON" step, the electrolyzer operates under a DC current of 0.6A cm(-2). In the "OFF" step, the electrocatalyst is subjected to a constant potential that is clearly more cathodic than its OER onset potential (namely, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 V vs. RHE) for 10 or 60s. The transition from the "ON" state to the "OFF" state occurs through a cathodic linear sweep voltammetry of a fast sweep rate to mimic the sudden changes in the renewable power. A NiCoOx/Ni-mesh electrode was used as a case study. The electrode showed remarkable durability under continuous operation (i = 0.6 A cm(-2)) for about 900 hours. However, it did suffer severe degradation after a certain number of ADT cycles, and the rate of degradation mainly depends on the potential value and the duration of the "OFF" step. Interestingly, the inclusion of the 10-sec open-circuit potential step after the "ON" step clearly mitigates the impact of energy fluctuations on the durability of OER electrocatalysts.

AB  - The low concentration of nickel in electroplating wastewater is difficult to treat to meet the discharge standard. In this study, a commercial cation exchange membrane was used to combine the electrodialysis on a titanium plate anode sintered ruthenium-iridium and the electrodeposition on a stainless steel cathode to reduce the nickel concentration to less 0.1 mg L-1. The electrolytic properties of the electrodialysis combined with the electrodeposition were investigated at different cell voltages, electrolysis time, initial electrolyte pH, electrolyte flow rates and initial Ni2+ concentrations. The results indicated that the Ni2+ concentration in the anolyte and the catholyte could be reduced to 0.015 and 0.085 mg L-1, respectively, with the initial Ni2+ concentration of 1.0 mg L-1, which could meet the most strict Ni2+ discharge standard of 0.1 mg L-1. The electrodeposition of Ni2+ on the cathode enhanced the migration of the Ni2thorn in the electrolytes, which was beneficial to decrease the energy consumption. Therefore, the combination of electrodialysis and electrodeposition was promising to reduce the low concentration of Ni2+ in the electroplating wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global-scale application of water splitting technology for hydrogen fuel production and storage of intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind has called for the development of oxygen evolution catalysts and hydrogen evolution catalysts that are inexpensive, efficient, robust, and can withstand frequent power interruptions and shutdowns. Current water electrolyzers must operate with a protective current in stand-by/idle modes to avoid a substantial catalyst degradation. Here, we show a hierarchically structured porous ternary composite catalyst of nickel, cobalt and iron (NiCoFe) hydroxides prepared via electrodeposition on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) substrates as reversible bifunctional electrodes for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NiCoFe/NF electrode exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity, requiring overpotentials as low as 220 and 50mV, respectively, for OER and HER to occur. In a water electrolysis cell comprising of two NiCoFe/NF electrodes, an overall cell overpotential of merely 300mV is required to deliver a stabilized current density of 3mAcm(-2). The ternary electrocatalyst also exhibits prolonged stability under both continuous and intermittent electrolysis and can be used for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reversibly without degradation.

AB  - Nanostructured nickel-black (Ni) was grown on copper (Cu-Ni) and stainless steel (SS-Ni) by using the potential controlled electrodeposition. Cu-Ni electrodes were deposited with the metal ions containing trithiocyanuric acid coordination polymeric thin-film (Cu-Ni-Tca) by electrochemical and chemical polymerization. The morphologies of Ni electrodeposits depend on the potentiostatic deposition conditions and after the metallopolymer coating. The XPS investigation of Cu-Ni-Tca electrodes reveals the presence of -S-M-11-S- and -S-S- linkages in the polymers. These inexpensive Cu-Ni-Tca hybrid electrodes exhibit a significant overpotential reduction, a long-term open circuit potential (OCP) stability and near OCP hydrogen evolution. The synergetic effect of the Cu-Ni-Tca hybrid electrode displays a significant improvement in the acidic stability. The Cu-Ni-Tca electrode prepared by electrodeposition method requires just 320 mV overvoltage to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) hydrogen evolution current density in 0.1 M HCl, which is relatively less in comparison to bare Cu-Ni (780 mV) and Cu (1050 mV) electrodes.

AB  - To find cheap, efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts is one of the major challenges when developing an alkaline water electrolysis system. In this paper we describe an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-modified Ni electrode, which could be used as a pre-eminent candidate for such a system. The experimentally determined characteristics of this electrode showing superior electrocatalytic activity were complemented by density functional theory calculations. Thermodynamic considerations led to the conclusion that H atoms, formed upon H2O discharge on Ni, spill onto the RGO, which serves as an H adatom acceptor, enabling continuous cleaning of Ni-active sites and an alternative pathway for H-2 production. This mode of action is rendered by the unique reactivity of RGO, which arises due to the presence of O surface groups within the graphene structure. The significant electrocatalytic activity and life time (435 days) of the RGO towards the HER under conditions of alkaline water electrolysis are demonstrated.

AB  - Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1, 2, 3, 4-5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl-, Br-) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13-14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start-shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst's passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP-Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm-2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr-1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.

AB  - Energy losses and purity of product gases in alkaline water electrolysis strongly depend on properties of a separator positioned between the electrodes. This paper reports on heterogeneous separators based on microporous polysulfone membranes modified by graft co-polymerization of acrylic acid. After neutralization with KOH, the pores of the modified membranes were filled with potassium polyacrylate, a superabsorbent material forming hydrogel upon intake of an aqueous electrolyte. Under electrolysis conditions of 50 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, increasing amount of hydrogel in pores suppresses hydrogen permeability without apparent reduction of ionic conductivity. We have identified the product of ionic resistance and hydrogen flux as a suitable parameter to compare performance of separators of various thickness. In terms of this parameter, present separators surpass the performance of ZirfonTM Perl UTP 500 tested under the identical conditions. Ex-situ aging test in 30 wt% KOH at 60 degrees C has revealed preservation of high wettability for up to 1340 h.

TI  - Cationic defect-enriched hydroxides as anodic catalysts for efficient seawater electrolysis
T2  - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
LA  - English
AB  - Seawater electrocatalysis driven by renewable energy resources has long been considered as a promising approach for producing clean hydrogen. However, anodic electrode materials suffer from severe issues such as large overpotential and electrochemical corrosion during seawater electrolysis due to the existence of abundant chloride ions. Herein, we report a cationic defect engineering approach to tailoring the structure of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline seawater-like solution. Impressively, the obtained cation defect-enriched NiFe LDH array exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 232 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability after 40 h electrolysis. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that CD-NiFe LDH-E facilitates charge transfer between metals (Ni/Fe) and oxygen (O), leading to inhibition of the competitive chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Moreover, homemade rechargeable Zn-air batteries with CD-NiFe LDH-E as the cathode are assembled, exhibiting high open circuit voltage (1.4 V) and excellent stability after 250 hours at a charging-discharging rate of 10 mA cm(-2). The strategy is expected to pave the way for the future development of high-performance electrocatalysts toward seawater splitting.

AB  - In this paper the influence of operating conditions on the product gas purity of a zero-gap alkaline water electrolyzer was examined. Precise knowledge of the resulting gas purity is of special importance to prevent safety shutdown when the electrolyzer is dynamically operated using a renewable energy source. The investigation in this study involves variation of temperature, electrolyte concentration and flow rate as well as different electrolyte management concepts. The experiments were carried out in a fully automated lab-scale electrolyzer with a 150 cm(2) zero-gap cell and approximately 31 wt% KOH at ambient and balanced cathodic and anodic pressure. The purity of the evolved gases was measured via online gas chromatography. It can be seen from the experiments that a temperature increase and flow rate decrease reduces the gas impurity when mixing catholyte and anolyte. A further reduction of gas impurity can be achieved when both cycles are being separated and a dynamic cycling strategy is applied. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH-/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high-valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH- ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as-derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.

AB  - The catalytic and durable electrode coating of ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), applied on nickel (Ni) substrates, is today utilized as electrocatalytic cathodes for hydrogen production, e.g., in the chlor-alkali process and alkaline water electrolysis. The drawback is, however, the sensitivity to reverse currents obtained during power shutdowns, e.g., at maintenance, where the RuO2-based electrodes can be severely damaged unless polarization rectifiers are employed. Through the material characterization techniques X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we can now reveal that RuO2 coatings, when exposed to hydrogen evolution at industrially relevant conditions, transforms into ruthenium oxyhydroxide (RuO(OH)(2)). The study further shows that as the hydrogen evolution proceeds the formed RuO(OH)(2) reduces to metallic ruthenium (Ru).

AB  - The highly effective and economical electrocatalysts hold great importance in the context of water electrolysis. In this work, a nanosheet catalyst (Ni3FeN/NF) composed of nanoparticles for comprehensive water splitting was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal technique followed by a subsequent nitridation process. This catalyst is endowed with an abundance of oxygen vacancies, thereby conferring a richer array of active sites. Therefore, the catalyst demonstrates a markedly low overpotential for the OER of 271 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and an equally low overpotential for the HER of 35 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Serving as a dual-function electrode, this electrocatalyst is employed in overall water splitting in alkaline environments, demonstrating impressive efficiency of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.45 V. In-situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the active phase and dynamic surface structure of the Ni3FeN/NF catalyst by conducting measurements at intervals of 0.1 V. At open circuit voltage (OCV), Ni3FeN/NF exhibited pronounced peaks at 532 and 702 cm(-1). Notably, at potentials exceeding 1.40 V, distinct peaks were observed at 473 and 551 cm(-1). The manifestation of these dual peaks indicates that gamma-Ni(Fe)OOH serves as the predominant active species in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism for Ni3FeN/NF.

AB  - Oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) is the most important reaction in hydrogen production from water splitting. Here we developed metal-carbon nanotubes (M-CNTs) hybrids with high metal oxide catalyst loading synthesized by arc-discharge and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods as electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline solutions. The M-CNTs hybrids produced by arc-discharge (M-CNTs-Arc) and CVD (M-CNTs-CVD) exhibit a core-shell-like structure, in which metal nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated by graphite shells are connected by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming M-CNTs network hybrids. M-CNTs-Arc has NiCo0.16Fe0.34 metal core and shows very high activity and superior stability for OER, achieving 100 A g(-1) at an overpotential (eta) of 0.29 V and 500 A g(-1) at eta = 0.37 V in 1 M KOH solution. This is probably the highest activity reported for OER in alkaline solutions. The reaction follows the first-order kinetics with respect to OH- concentration and Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). The results demonstrate a highly efficient, scalable, and lowcost one-step synthesis method for developing highly active and stable catalysts for electrochemical water splitting in alkaline solutions.

AB  - We have developed a novel, efficient and economical composite electrode for hydrogen production. The electrode has been formed by embedding graphene in the Fe-Ni matrix via room temperature electrodeposition. The obtained active coatings have been tested for their efficiency and performance as electrode surfaces for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 6 M KOH by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques. The coating obtained at 60 mA cm(-2) exhibited approximately 3 times higher activity for hydrogen production than that of binary Fe-Ni alloy. Addition of graphene to electrolyte bath resulted in porous 3D projections of nano-sized spheres of Fe-Ni on the surface of graphene, which effectively increased the electrochemically active surface area. XPS analysis results showed the equal distribution of both Ni metal and NiO active sites on the composite. The addition of graphene favoured the deposition of metallic nickel, which accelerated the rate determining proton discharge reaction. All these factors remarkably enhanced the HER activity of Fe-Ni-Graphene (Fe-Ni-G) composite electrode. The Tafel slope analysis showed that the HER follows Volmer-Tafel mechanism. The structure -property relationship of Fe-Ni-G coating has been discussed by interpreting field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Xray diffraction (XRD) analysis results.

AB  - Manganese electrodeposition experiments were performed in an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis reactor using Ti/IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 anode. The influence of Mn2+ concentration, cathode current density (CCD), (NH4)(2)SO4 concentration, SeO2 concentration and electrolysis time on the cell voltage (CV), cathode current efficiency (CE) and specific energy consumption (SEC) of manganese electrodeposition was investigated. The crystalline structure, chemical composition and morphology of the deposited manganese metal and the generated dark mass were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements. The obtained results reveal that the crystalline structure of the deposited manganese metal was alpha-Mn. The dark mass of MnOOH would be generated and precipitated on the surface of the cathode, inhibiting the electrodeposition of manganese metal when the operating condition was not well controlled. Considering the CE, SEC and environmental aspect, the operating condition of Mn2+ concentration = 30 g L-1, CCD = 350 A m(-2), (NH4)(2)SO4 concentration = 110 g L-1 and SeO2 concentration = 0.03 g L-1 was regarded as the best condition for manganese electrodeposition. Under this condition, the CE was 78.3% and the SEC was 4346-4433 kW h t(-1) after electrolyzing for 24 h. Compared with the traditional approach, the CE increased by about 10% and the SEC decreased by about 27%. In addition, the electrolytic manganese anode slime was not generated during the manganese electrodeposition process. This approach is recommended as it will reduce the energy consumption and the quantities of solid waste discharge of manganese electrodeposition. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is studied on nickel and cobalt-containing electrocatalysts. CoMo, NiMo, and ReNi alloys are obtained by electrodeposition, while NiReP catalysts are prepared by electroless deposition under open-circuit conditions using hypophosphite ions as a reducing agent.
   The prepared materials are characterized by a complex of modern physical methods; namely, SEM, XPS, XRD, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. No long-range order was found for all electrodeposited alloys whereas NiReP alloys prepared by electroless deposition contain nickel phosphides. A certain amount of molybdenum or rhenium in the CoMo and ReNi alloys is in the oxidized states. CoMo and ReNi coatings contain 15-20 at. % of oxygen in the form of O2-.
   Molybdenum containing alloys are unstable in the alkaline solutions under electrolysis conditions. In opposite, NiRe electrodeposits are promising candidates for hydrogen evolution catalysis in alkaline solutions due to their high catalytic activity and stability under electrolysis conditions.
   NiReP alloys can be used for HER catalysis in acidic solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the valence dynamics of thin films during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction using operando high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in a 0.1 M KOH solution under an applied potential. We show that it is possible to measure the 10 unit cell (similar to 4 nm) bimetallic perovskite oxide La2CoMnO6 thin film grown on Pt-covered SiN x membranes. Operando Co and Mn K-edge HERFD XAS spectra on the active surface species were recorded from the backside of the SiN x membrane. The HERFD XAS Co K-edge spectra reveal a (partial) increase in the oxidation state from Co2+ in ex situ conditions to mainly Co3+ in the solid-liquid open-circuit voltage (OCV). Voltage-dependent Co K-edge HERFD XAS white line intensities show that Co is oxidized toward the higher oxidation state, while Mn remains Mn4+. Interestingly, the Co and Mn main edge shifts with the average valence change of 0.20; the valence of Mn is constant, implying that the valence of Co increases by 0.40. The OCV spectra were reversible when switching off the potentials. These observations clearly identify element-specific valence dynamics in the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction.

AB  - CO2 electrolysis allows the sustainable production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals. However, state-of-the-art CO2 electrolysers employing anion exchange membranes (AEMs) suffer from (bi)carbonate crossover, causing low CO2 utilization and limiting anode choices to those based on precious metals. Here we argue that bipolar membranes (BPMs) could become the primary option for intrinsically stable and efficient CO2 electrolysis without the use of scarce metals. Although both reverse- and forward-bias BPMs can inhibit CO2 crossover, forward-bias BPMs fail to solve the rare-earth metals requirement at the anode. Unfortunately, reverse-bias BPM systems presently exhibit comparatively lower Faradaic efficiencies and higher cell voltages than AEM-based systems. We argue that these performance challenges can be overcome by focusing research on optimizing the catalyst, reaction microenvironment and alkali cation availability. Furthermore, BPMs can be improved by using thinner layers and a suitable water dissociation catalyst, thus alleviating core remaining challenges in CO2 electrolysis to bring this technology to the industrial scale.

AB  - optimize pH environments for electrochemical synthesis applications when employed in reverse bias. Unfortunately, the performance of BPMs in reverse bias has long been limited by the rate of water dissociation (WD) occurring at the interface of the BPM. Herein, we develop a continuum model of the BPM that agrees with experiment to understand and enhance WD catalyst performance by considering multiple kinetic pathways for WD in the BPM junction catalyst layer. The model reveals that WD catalysts with a more highly alkaline or acidic pH at the point of zero charge (pHPZC) exhibit accelerated WD kinetics because the more acidic or alkaline pHPZC catalysts possess greater surface charge, enhancing the local electric field and rate of WD. The model is then employed to explore the sensitivity of the BPM performance to various BPM physical parameters. Finally, the model is used to simulate the operation of bimetallic WD catalysts, demonstrating that an optimal bimetallic catalyst has an acidic pHPZC catalyst matched with the cation-exchange layer and an alkaline pHPZC catalyst matched with the anion-exchange layer. The study provides insight into the operation of BPM WD catalysts and gives direction toward the development of next-generation WD catalysts for optimal BPM performance under water-splitting and related conditions.

AB  - This study introduces a cost-effective and sustainable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst by integrating cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4) with carbon derived from neem leaves (NC), forming a Co3O4@NC composite. The Co3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized via a hydrothermal method, and the composite was thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Electrochemical evaluation in anion exchange membrane fuel cells revealed that the Co3O4@NC catalyst exhibits comparable performance to a commercial 40 wt% Pt/C catalyst, achieving an open circuit potential of 0.93 V versus 0.96 V for Pt/C. At a mass loading of 1 mg/cm2, the Co3O4@NC catalyst delivered a maximum power density of 42.60 mW/cm2. These findings demonstrate the potential of Co3O4@NC, derived from a renewable biomass source, as a promising and sustainable alternative to expensive platinum-based catalysts for ORR applications.

AB  - Grid scale electricity storage on daily and seasonal time scales is required to accommodate increasing amounts of renewable electricity from wind and solar power. We have developed for the first time an integrated battery-electrolyser (`battolyser') that efficiently stores electricity as a nickel-iron battery and can split water into hydrogen and oxygen as an alkaline electrolyser. During charge insertion the Ni(OH)(2) and Fe(OH)(2) electrodes form nanostructured NiOOH and reduced Fe, which act as efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution catalysts respectively. The charged electrodes use all excess electricity for efficient electrolysis, while they can be discharged at any time to provide electricity when needed. Our results demonstrate a remarkable constant and a high overall energy efficiency (80-90%), enhanced electrode storage density, fast current switching capabilities, and a general stable performance. The battolyser may enable efficient and robust short-term electricity storage and long-term electricity storage through production of hydrogen as a fuel and feedstock within a single, scalable, abundant element based device.

AB  - Commercial Ni foams were modified by spontaneous deposition of Rh nanoparticles, achieved by immersion of foam samples in acid, deaerated Na3RhCl6 solutions, at open circuit. The surface area of the Rh deposits was estimated, for different Rh loadings, by measuring the H adsorption/desorption charge. The surface area per unit Rh mass was found to exceed 50 m(2) g(-1), for loading values below 2 mg cm(-3.) The Rh-modified Ni foam electrodes were used as cathodes for the reduction of nitrate ions, and showed good catalytic activity, increasing with the Rh loading in a sublinear way; thus, the mass activity of the electrodes was higher at low loading. Prolonged electrolyses showed that the Rh-modified Ni foam electrodes underwent only moderate poisoning. Ion chromatography was used to assess the reaction products: irrespective of the Rh loading, ammonia was the main product, and nitrite accounted only for a few percent of the reduced nitrate. The beneficial effect of forcing a solution flow through the foam pores on the nitrate reduction current was shown.

AB  - Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are two critical electrocatalytic reactions, involved in many sustainable and green electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies. Transition metal-based compound combined with carbon materials have been found to be effective catalysts toward the HER and ORR with great potential to replace conventional precious metal-based catalysts. Herein, a low-cost method is described for the fabrication and testing of sulfide (CoS)/carbon compound with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure by using peptone as raw material and NaCl as template. The obtained materials showed open structures composed of interconnected thin carbon nanosheets with transition metal-based nanoparticles wrapped inside the carbon matrix. These as-prepared materials were used as HER and ORR bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis and Zn-air battery. In the alkaline media, the optimized catalysts exhibited highly efficient electrocatalysis toward the HER. They also showed an outstanding ORR activity and durability which was found to be superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts. In an assembled primary Zn-air cell containing the optimized sample, the open circuit voltage (OCV) was 1.44 V, higher than the value for Zn-air cell containing Pt/C. The assembled Zn-air cell delivered a power density of 119 mW cm(-2) at 150 mA cm(-2), higher than the Pt/C cell (97 mW cm(-2) at 150 mA cm(-2)).

AB  - A renewable power-based energy system will require both shortand long-term electricity storage and conversion to hydrogenbased fuels. This study investigates 3D electrodes for an integrated alkaline Ni-Fe battery and electrolyzer. The dual system can sustain current densities similar to those in alkaline electrolyzers while pacities. We demonstrate that the combination of microporosity and a conductive three-dimensional (3D) electrode design with macroscopic channels enables the required current densities during charge, electrolysis, and discharge. The ionic conduction in the 3D electrode enables higher utilization of the active electrode mass and lower overpotentials during both the (dis)charge reaction and electrolysis. The double function of these electrodes is understood from a general statistical model and a more detailed porous-elecforward, accessible with industrially established techniques, to these higher-power and higher-energy-density electrodes.

AB  - Constructing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts with oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the development of zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs) and overall water splitting (OWS) is significant, but still challenging. Herein, we have fabricated a heterojunction catalyst (Fe,CoZn9+9-NO/WC) featuring uniformly dispersed Fe and Co coordinated with riched-nitrogen/oxygen codoped into a three-dimensional highly porous tungsten-carbon matrix modified carbon nanotube by a simple stepwise construction route using water as the solvent. The resultant Fe,CoZn9+9-NO/WC exhibits a positive halfwave potential (E1/2) of 0.889 V for ORR, a low overpotential at 10 mA center dot cm- 2 for OER (290 mV) and HER (84 mV), and excellent electrochemical durability in alkaline electrolyte, outperforming even benchmark catalysts. Moreover, Fe,CoZn9+9-NO/WC as a bifunctional air cathode for ZAFBs delivers higher open circuit voltage, peak power density (190 mW center dot cm- 2), and specific capacity (814 mAh center dot g- 1), lower charge/discharge voltage gap and prolonged operational cycles durability, largely exceeding those of the hybrid Pt/C+RuO2 bifunctional catalyst. The alkaline OWS electrolyzer is constructed by Fe,CoZn9+9-NO/WC with good stability and requires only 1.556 V cell voltage at 10 mA center dot cm- 2. Impressively, the self-constructed Fe,CoZn9+9-NO/WC electrodes were applied to practical ZAFBs and OWS devices, demonstrating superior performance to the recently reported ZIF/MOFderived catalysts in organic solvents. This work offers an economical synthetic strategy to prepare highly efficient multifunctional catalysts with practical potential for commercial production, promising to facilitate the development of clean energy storage and conversion devices.

AB  - Solid oxide cells (SOCs) can be operated either as fuel cells (SOFC) to convert fuels to electricity or as electrolyzers (SOEC) to convert electricity to fuels such as hydrogen or methane. Pressurized operation of SOCs provide several benefits on both cell and system level. If successfully matured, pressurized SOEC based electrolyzers can become more efficient both energy-and cost-wise than PEM and Alkaline systems. Pressurization of SOFCs can significantly increase the cell power density and reduce the size of auxiliary components. In the present study, a SOC stack was successfully operated at pressures up to 25 bar. The pressure dependency of the measured current-voltage (I-V) curves and impedance spectra on the SOC stack are analyzed and the relation between various system parameters and pressure is derived. With increasing pressure the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the reaction kinetics (electrode performance) increases for thermodynamic and kinetic reasons, respectively. Further, the summit frequency of the gas concentration impedance arc and the pressure difference across the stack and heat exchangers is seen to decrease with increasing pressure following a power-law expression. Finally a durability test was conducted at 10 bar.

AB  - Reliability and long-term performance are the key features of modern energy storage and conversion devices. The long-term stability depends entirely on the electrochemical and corrosion properties of device components. Single-phase mesoporous Ni-rich Ni-Pt thin films have shown to be a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and therefore with potential application in fuel cells, water electrolysers or similar devices. The HER activity of the mesoporous Ni-Pt films is reliable and stable in 0.5 M H2SO4 up to 200 linear sweep voltammetry cycles, however leaching of Ni occurs in absence of cathodic polarisation. Long-term electrolysis measurements at a HER current of -10 mA/cm(2) reveal an increase in potential over time, which is minimised when the Pt content is increased. In 1 M NaOH, the material is stable up to an applied anodic limit of 1.5 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl although surface passivation takes place at 1.0 V. If the anodic limit does not exceed 0.6 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl, a fully reversible redox reaction is observed by cyclic voltammetry, with redox charges increasing with Pt content and scan speed. In addition, significantly higher current densities are recorded for mesoporous films compared to dense counterparts. This charge/discharge behaviour of the redox reaction indicates that the mesoporous Ni-Pt films may as well be used as an electrochemical supercapacitor. As a HER catalyst, the material is safely applicable in alkaline media. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Inspired by the more positive (about 0.38 V nobler) discharge potential of hydrogen on Ni-W alloy compared to that on both Ni and W, a Ni-W alloy has been developed electrolytically as an efficient electrode material for water electrolysis. The deposition conditions, for peak performance of the electrodeposits for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH medium have been optimized. Electrocatalytic activity of the coatings, deposited at different current densities (c.d.'s) for water splitting reactions of HER and OER was tested by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. It was found that Ni-W alloys deposited, at 4.0 A/dm(2) (having about 12.49 wt.% W) and 1.0 A/dm(2) (having about 0.95 wt.% W) are good electrode materials as cathode (for HER) and anode (for OER), respectively. A dependency of the electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER with relative amount of Ni and W, in the deposit was found. The variation of electrocatalytic activity with W content showed the existence of a synergism between high-catalytic property of W (due to low hydrogen overvoltage) and Ni (having increased adsorption of OH- ions), for hydrogen (as cathode) and oxygen (as anode) evolution, respectively. Electrocatalytic activities of the coatings, developed at different c.d.'s were explained in the light of their phase structure, surface morphology, and chemical composition, confirmed by XRD, FESEM, and EDX analysis. The effect of c.d. on thickness, hardness, composition, HER, and OER was analyzed, and results were discussed with possible mechanisms.

AB  - Bipolar Membranes (BPMs) are pivotal in advancing sustainable energy and environmental management technologies. This review explores the fundamental concepts and recent advancements of BPM technology, emphasizing its essential role in green energy production and resource recovery. A key contribution of this study is the detailed analysis of bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED), an innovative process that produces acids and bases from salt solutions without chemical additives, offering enhanced energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. We examine the operational mechanisms of BPMs under forward and reverse bias, focusing on their integration into applications such as water electrolysis for hydrogen generation, fuel cells, redox flow batteries, and CO2 electrolysis. Our findings demonstrate that BPM-integrated systems significantly enhance sustainability, particularly in wastewater treatment, ammonia nitrogen recovery, and nutrient recovery. Despite these advancements, challenges like membrane stability and scalability remain. We propose future research directions to optimize BPM and BMED technologies for scalable, sustainable industrial solutions.

AB  - Municipal nanofiltration (NF) concentrate generally contains sulfate and divalent cations. In this study, the SO42-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were recovered by the two-step ion exchange membrane (IEM) electrolysis, which included anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis and subsequent cation exchange membrane (CEM) electrolysis. The results showed that the AEM electrolysis recovered calcium ions and magnesium ions by forming calcium carbonate crystals and amorphous magnesium hydroxide and simultaneously concentrated the sulfate into the anode chamber; while the CEM electrolysis promoted the formation of ettringite, amorphous magnesium hydroxide, and other precipitates with the assistance of calcium hydroxide and sodium metaaluminate, thereby recovering the sulfate and divalent cations in the NF concentrate. The calcium cation, magnesium cation, and sulfate anion concentrations were reduced by 80.0 %, 93.3 %, and 43.1 %, respectively. In addition, the dissolved organic carbon was removed by 31.0 % through the two-step membrane electrolysis. The AEM fouling was much greater than that of the CEM. The total energy consumption of the two-step IEM electrolysis process was calculated as 4.3-6.7 kWh/m(3). These findings provide practical relevance for the advanced treatment of municipal NF concentrate.

AB  - Photo-assisted electrocatalysis presents a promising route for boosting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet developing efficient, single-component photo-assisted electrocatalysts remains challenging. Perovskite fluorides (ABF3) show potential but suffer from intrinsically wide bandgaps and unclear OER mechanisms. Herein, we first report the fluoride-perovskite-based photo-assisted OER catalyst K(CoNi)0.8Fe0.2F3 (KCNFe0.2F3). The optimized KCNFe0.2F3 achieves exceptional performance with an ultralow overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec-1 . Remarkably, an integrated membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer employing KCNFe0.2F3 as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates stable alkaline water electrolysis at 1 A cm-2 for 300 h. Furthermore, when KCNFe0.2F3 was assembled with Pt/C into a photo-assisted zinc-air battery, an open-circuit voltage of 1.49 V was achieved, with stable operation for 25 h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Fe doping induces a super-exchange effect that tailors the B-site coordination environment in KCNFe0.2F3, consequently narrowing the bandgap and accelerating photocarrier dynamics. This synergistic effect generates abundant photogenerated charge carriers, which drive KCNFe0.2F3 rapid reconstruction into highly active NiCoFeOOH species at lower potentials, thus significantly enhancing OER kinetics. This work establishes a scalable design paradigm for developing stable, high-activity perovskite electrocatalysts through photon-energy coupling.

AB  - The rational design and synthesis of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy technologies is of significant interest. Herein, we demonstrate a novel approach for the synthesis of a nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped mesoporous carbon-encapsulated iron phosphide (FeP@NPC) nanostructure and its multifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward an oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction for zinc-air battery (ZAB) and alkaline water-splitting applications. FeP@NPC is obtained by the carbothermal reduction of the precursor complex [Fe(bpy)(3)](PF6)(2) in the presence of melamine without any traditional phosphidating agent. The PF6- counteranion is used for the phosphidation of Fe. FeP@NPC obtained at 900 degrees C (FeP@NPC-900) exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance with a very low potential gap (Delta E = E-1/2(ORR) - E-j10(OER)) of 670 mV. The ZAB device delivers a peak power density of 190.15 mW cm(-2) (iR-corrected), specific capacity of 785 mA h g(zn)(-1), and energy density of 706.5 Wh kg(zn)(-1) at SO mA cm(-2). The ZAB exhibits excellent charge-discharge cycling stability for over 35 h with negligible voltaic efficiency loss (0.9%). Three CR2032 coin-cell-based ZABs made of an FeP@NPC-900 air cathode connected in series power 81 LEDs for 15 min. FeP@NPC-900 also has promising electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting in acidic as well as in alkaline pH. The benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved with a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer at a cell voltage of 1.65 V. ZAB-powered water electrolyzer is made by integrating two rechargeable ZABs connected in series with the two-electrode water electrolyzer. The ZAB powers the electrolyzer for 24 h without a significant loss in the open-circuit voltage. The catalyst retains its initial structural integrity even after continuous water electrolysis for 24 h.

AB  - Versatile electrocatalysts made from Earth-rich elements are essential for the design of energy storage and conversion devices such as those involved in electrolytic water splitting and zinc-air batteries. In this research, MOF-derived rod-like Fe-Se-C and P@Fe-Se-C nanocatalysts were applied to modify various active species on catalytic structures. TEM, XRD, XPS, and XAS characterization of the MOF nanorod scaffold indicated a high abundance of catalytically active species, including the P@Fe-Se-C composite encased in Se on a carbon layer. High dual-functional activity of the OER with eta 10 = 359 mV and the ORR with E1/2 = 0.77 V, similar to those of commercial IrO2 and Pt/C, was seen for Fe-Se-C. Additionally, the HER activity of the P@Fe-Se-C catalyst was eta 10 = 211 mV. In addition, Zn-air batteries (ZABs) exhibited better charge-discharge cycling stability and an ideally stable open-circuit voltage of 1.58 V (P@Fe-Se-C). For overall water electrolysis, an optimal cell voltage of 1.43 V (P@Fe-Se-C) achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2. According to DFT, there was an important change in the electrocatalytic activity of P@Fe-Se-C and Fe-Se-C and the electronic structure, conductivity, and cycling stability of the catalyst over time. This study shows how creative material design can improve energy efficiency and provide multifunctionality.

AB  - Nanostructured trimetallic phosphide electrocatalysts are promising for H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (HER/OER) that are actively pursued nowadays to achieve commercial hydrogen production. Herein, a dual-functional Nb-doped NiFe phosphide nanosheet catalyst with a low cost and high stability was successfully prepared on nickel foam (NF) pretreated with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas (PNF) operated under ambient conditions. The resulting Ni12P5-Fe2P-NbP layered nanosheets on the PNF show exceptional catalytic performances, evidenced by their low overpotentials for delivering current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2) (j(100)/j(400)) of only 178 and 265 mV for the HER, and 280 and 330 mV for the OER, as well as the small Tafel slope values of 52 (HER) and 59 (OER) mV dec(-1), respectively. The catalyst also exhibits a good electrocatalytic durability and stability during 100 h continuous HER and OER tests at j(300). Moreover, the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) are achieved at low cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.65 V, thus outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts in two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzers. Numerical simulation analysis shows that the Ni and Nb atoms in the Ni12P5-Fe2P-NbP nanostructures are the key factors responsible for the achieved excellent performance in water electrolysis.

AB  - The features of the formation of hybrid electrode materials based on carbon fabric modified with oxides of molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, iron, and tungsten upon polarization by an alternating asymmetric current are studied. It is shown that the fabricated hybrid materials are multiphase systems, the morphology of their surface is characterized by a fragmentary structure. A study of the electrochemical behavior of the produced hybrid materials was condicted during their cycling in an alkaline electrolyte. The calculated specific capacity were 472, 1018, 1496, 1990 mF cm(-2) at current densities of 30, 12, 6, 3 mA cm(-2), respectively. The resulting hybrid electrode materials retain their specific capacity up to 77% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles, which suggests the possibility of their use in symmetrical supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte.

AB  - The lamination of a cation exchange layer (CEL) and an anion exchange layer (AEL) to form a hybrid bipolar membrane (BPM) can have several unique advantages over conventional monopolar ion exchange membranes in (photo-)electrolysis. Upon application of a reverse bias, the ordinarily slow water dissociation reaction at the AEL/CEL junction of the BPM is dramatically accelerated by the large electric field at the interface and by the presence of catalyst in the junction. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we have found a counterbalanced role of the electric field and the junction catalyst in accelerating water dissociation in a BPM. Experimental BPMs were prepared from a crosslinked AEL and a Nafion CEL, with a graphite oxide (GO) catalyst deposited at the junction using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. BPMs with an interfacial catalyst layer were found to have smaller electric fields at the interface compared to samples with no added catalyst. A comprehensive numerical simulation model showed that the damping of the electric field in BPMs with a catalyst layer is a result of a higher water dissociation product (H+/OH-) flux, which neutralizes the net charge density of the CEL and AEL. This conclusion is further substantiated by EIS studies of a high-performance 3D junction BPM that shows a low electric field due to the facile catalytic generation and transport of H+ and OH-. Numerical modeling of these effects in the BPM provides a prescription for designing membranes that function at lower overpotential. The potential drop across the synthetic BPM was lower than that of a commercial BPM by more than 200 mV at >100 mA cm(-2) reverse bias current density, with the two membranes having similar long-term stability.

AB  - Ni0.6-xMo0.4-xIrx-oxide coatings were fabricated with the purpose of investigating the influence of Ir content on their charge storage/delivery capability when used as an electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. Experimental work in alkaline medium confirmed that the amount of Ir in the Ni-Mo-oxide significantly influences the material's charge storage capacity. The highest overall capacitance (108 +/- 2 mFcm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2)) was obtained for the composition containing 40 mol% of Ir (Ni0.36Mo0.24Ir0.4-oxide), while the best candidates in terms of the intrinsic (surface area-independent) charge storage/ delivery are the compositions containing 20 and 40 mol% of Ir (no statistical difference). Ni0.36Mo0.24Ir0.4-oxide was found to retain ca. 86% of its initial capacitance after 2500 charge-discharge cycles, at 1 mA cm(-2).

AB  - Recent advancements in energy conversion and storage systems have placed a spotlight on the role of multi-functional electrodes employing conductive substrates. These substrates, however, often face obstacles due to intricate and expensive production methods, as well as limitations in thickness. This research introduces a novel, economical approach using graphite felt as a versatile electrode. A method to enhance the typically low conductivity of graphite felt was devised, incorporating interfacial chemical tuning and the electrodeposition of a highly conductive nickel layer. This technique facilitates the integration of diverse transition metal-based active sites, aiming to refine the catalytic activity for specific electrochemical reactions. A key finding is that a combination of a nickel-rich cathode and an iron-rich anode can effectively optimize alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production at the ampere scale. Furthermore, the addition of sulfur improves the bi-functional oxygen-related redox reactions, rendering it ideal for air cathodes in solid-state zinc-air batteries. The assembled battery exhibits impressive performance, including a peak power density of 62.9 mW cm-2, a minimal voltage gap in discharge-charge polarization, and a lifecycle surpassing 70 h. This advancement in electrode technology signifies a significant leap in energy storage and conversion, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for future energy systems.

AB  - Cost-effective alkaline water splitting represents a promising and sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, the prevention of hydrogen/oxygen mixing and the efficient use of unstable renewable energy are challenging issues. Herein, we propose a novel solution involving the integration of a nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery as a redox mediator and affordable a NiFe LDHs-NiFe alloy gradient hybrid bifunctional catalysts as gas evolution electrodes, effectively decoupling the hydrogen and oxygen evolution processes during water splitting. Then, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cell using hydrogen storage alloy and catalytic electrode only requires 0.28 V and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cell using nickel hydroxide and catalytic electrode only requires 0.25 V to reach a high current density of 100 mA cm-2. Furthermore, a NiOOH-Zn cell is introduced as an alternative, replacing the OER reaction with Zn. This NiOOH-Zn cell can be discharged without further energy input. Moreover, such a decoupled water electrolysis system can seamlessly integrate with a Ni-MH battery, providing the flexibility to efficiently convert renewable energy sources into both hydrogen and electricity. This integrated system maximizes the utilization of renewable energy, making a significant contribution to sustainable energy production.

AB  - Highly efficient multifunctional earth-abundant elements based electrocatalysts are key important for development of clean energy transformation technologies, such as metal-air batteries, fuel cells and water electrolysis. Herein, composite catalysts of N-doped carbon wrapping Cox P hollow spheres have been successfully prepared by pyrolysis of precursors from self-assembly of cobalt salt, terephthalic acid and PVP followed by carbonization and phosphatization in the presence of sodium hypophosphite. The resulted composites showed high specific surface areas, pore volumes and nitrogen contents, especially more than 47% of pyridinic-N. The electrocatalytic activity tests showed that the optimized CoxP-NC-420 sample exhibited superior multifunctional performances and high stabilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. A low overpotential of 125/273 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 66/81 mV dec(-1) was obtained for HER and OER, respectively. As for ORR, as high as 0.860 V of half-wave potential was obtained, which is even 36 mV higher than that of Pt/C (20%). The catalyst also exhibited high practical performances on water electrolysis and Zn -air battery. Only 1.61 V of cell voltage was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for water electrolysis, and 1.374 V of open-circuit potential and 52 mW cm(-2) of power density were obtained for Zn -air battery, which was 16 mW cm(-2) higher than that of Pt/C (20%). Moreover, a highly effcient self-driven water electrolyzer has been designed with CoxP-NC-420 as both anode and cathode catalyst, powered by two-series-connected CoxP-NC-420-based Zn-air batteries. This work provides a new strategy for fabrication of non-precious multifunctional electrocatalysts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficiency of cathodes for water electrolysis decreases after shut-downs due to corrosion at open-circuit potential. In the present work the effect of prepolarization at various potentials on hydrogen entry into iron during cathodic potential sweeps was studied by the measurement of the hydrogen permeation rate (HPR) through a 35-mu m thick iron membrane in 0.1 M NaOH without and with EDTA or Na2MoO4 at 25 degrees C. Two types of the enhanced hydrogen entry at low cathodic polarizations were distinguished: one after prepolarization at low cathodic or low anodic potentials, and another after prepolarization at high anodic potentials. It is suggested that both types can be explained by acidification at the metal surface, the former due to anodic oxidation of iron, and the latter due to cathodic reduction of oxide layer (mainly of Fe3O4). XPS analysis revealed the presence of hydrated Fe-O species of unidentified valence. EDTA and Na2MoO4 increased the efficiency of hydrogen entry (j(H)/j(c), ratio), and molyklates also strongly increased cathodic currents of HER. Some of the effects of these additives can be explained in terms of their effect on surface layers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an efficient tool that reveals the electrochemical characteristics of catalysts, surfaces, interfaces, coatings, and so forth. Use of EIS in different areas of energy research wherever current, potential, and charge determine the performance has become inevitable. Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of such fields focused on generating high purity hydrogen, where EIS is used to correlate the activity trends measuring charge transfer resistances (R-ct). In doing so, different conventions are followed. A few perform EIS at the open circuit potential (OCP), a few perform at onset potential or at a potential before onset potential, a few perform at different potentials for different catalysts at which they deliver the same current density, and a large group of people choose a constant potential beyond onset, at which all the studied catalysts show appreciable catalytic activity. Existence of such different practices in using EIS to characterize water splitting electrocatalysts often lead to misinterpretation of the activity trends. Hence, to provide a clear view on the appropriate use of EIS in water splitting electrocatalysis, we have carried out a comparative EIS study on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity trend of stainless steel 304 (SS-304), Co, Ni, and Cu foils in 1 M KOH at all the above-stated conditions and the results showed that the EIS carried out at constant potentials in the catalytic turnover region is appropriate.

AB  - Designing electrocatalysts that excel in hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry is crucial for sustainable hydrogen generation through electrochemical water splitting. This study presents a novel tricomponent catalyst composed of an alginate hydrogel (AL) infused with single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles. The catalyst exhibits benchmark-close bifunctional activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. The aerophobic nature of the AL-gel facilitates superior bubble release from the electrode, while the inclusion of CNTs mitigates charge transfer resistance. Moreover, heterojunctions of CuO and CNTs create unique interfacial active sites, culminating in high electrocatalytic water-splitting activity. The structural rigidity of the composite permits its use as self-standing electrodes (SSE) without using substrates or binders, enabling a direct evaluation of its activity. The composite electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic HER activity in an alkaline solution, with onset potentials of 93 mV and moderate OER activity with an onset of 155 mV. Moreover, a water electrolysis cell featuring the bifunctional SSE exhibits an open circuit voltage of 1.85 V at 100 mA.cm(-2), and only 8% efficiency loss after 100 h marking this a significant stride in developing self-standing nonprecious electrocatalysts with impressive catalytic performance.

AB  - A unique three-dimensional (3D) structure consisting of a hierarchical nickel-cobalt dichalcogenide spinel nanostructure is investigated for its electrocatalytic properties at benign neutral and alkaline pH and applied as an air cathode for practical zinc-air batteries. The results show a high oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity of nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4 NS/CC) over the commercial benchmarking catalyst under both pH conditions. In particular, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC air cathode shows high discharge capacity, a narrow potential gap between discharge and charge, and superior cycle durability with reversibility, which exceeds that of commercial precious metal-based electrodes. The excellent performance of NiCo2S4 NS/CC in water electrolyzers and zinc-air batteries is mainly due to highly exposed electroactive sites with a rough surface, morphology-based advantages of nanosheet arrays, good adhesion between NiCo2S4 and the conducting carbon cloth, and the active layer formed of nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxides during water splitting. These results suggest that NiCo2S4 NS/CC could be a promising candidate as an efficient electrode for high-performance water electrolyzers and rechargeable zinc-air batteries.

AB  - The effect of different substrate materials in the fabrication of an electrode intended for use in the water oxidation reaction is investigated. The electrocatalyst is nickel-iron oxide (NiFeOx) which is deposited by chronoamperometry on nickel, iron, titanium, and stainless steel substrates. The process of electrodeposition is optimized to achieve the lowest overpotential for the water oxidation reaction. The four electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) to describe the effect of the substrate on the nature of the electrocatalyst layer. Electrochemical tests in 1 m NaOH are applied on the four electrodes to assess the stability and the retention of the electrocatalytic properties of the whole electrode. All electrodes show similar overpotential of approximate to 0.3 V at 10 mA cm-2 implying that the substrate do not affect the electrocatalytic activity of the NiFeOx. After use, the overpotential increases in a range of 30-50 mV for nickel, iron, and titanium substrates, while stainless steel retains the lowest overpotential with an increase of 10 mV. This limited variation can be the effect of smaller NiFeOx nanoparticles compared to other substrates. XPS analysis reveals that after galvanostatic electrolysis, the oxidation state of Fe shifts slightly from Fe(II) to Fe(III), likely Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, while NiO/Ni2O3 change partially to Ni(OH)2.
   The water oxidation reaction in alkaline condition is investigated for the NiFeOx electrocatalyst which is deposited on different substrates, namely nickel, iron, titanium, and stainless steel. Limited effect is observed on overpotential and Tafel slope. The stability under galvanostatic electrolysis is highest for the stainless-steel substrate. image

AB  - The electrochemical nitrogen and nitrate reduction reactions (E-NRR and E-NO3RR) promise to provide decentralized and fossil-fuel-free ammonia synthesis, and as a result, E-NRR and E-NO3RR research has surged in recent years. Membrane NH3/NH4+ crossover during E-NRR and E-NO3RR decreases Faradaic efficiency and thus the overall yield. During catalyst evaluation, such unaccounted-for crossover results in measurement error. Herein, several commercially available membranes were screened and evaluated for use in ammonia-generating electrolyzers. NH3/NH4+ crossover of the commonly used cation-exchange membrane (CEM) Nafion 212 was measured in an H-cell architecture and found to be significant. Interestingly, some anion exchange membranes (AEMs) show negligible NH4+ crossover, addressing the problem of measurement error due to NH4+ crossover. Further investigation of select membranes in a zero-gap gas diffusion electrode (GDE)-cell determines that most membranes show significant NH3 crossover when the cell is in an open circuit. However, uptake and crossover of NH3 are mitigated when -1.6 V is applied across the GDE-cell. The results of this study present AEMs as a useful alternative to CEMs for H-cell E-NRR and E-NO3RR electrolyzer studies and present critical insight into membrane crossover in zero-gap GDE-cell E-NRR and E-NO3RR electrolyzers.

AB  - Electrochemical water splitting is crucial for the decarbonization of industrial processes and the coupling of renewable energy sources. Evaluation of individual HER and OER contributions to the transfer process is essential for optimizing electrolysis system performance. This study uses nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) as a solid-state redox mediator (SRM), achieving efficient H2 and O2 separation. This study provides an in-depth analysis of kinetic and ion/charge/mass transfer mechanisms linked to various characteristic impedances in alkaline decoupled water electrolysis (DWE) system by integrating Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Distribution of Relaxation Times (DRT) methods. The characteristic frequency evolution is consistent with the charge-discharge state of SRM and mass transfer frequency is related to the bubble size and gas diffusion rate of electrocatalysts at different current densities. The charge transfer Rct dominates the total polarization impedance in decoupled HER, and mass transfer Rm decreases remarkably in decoupled OER. OER shows lower Rct with Fe species existence and lower total polarization impedance than HER. Rm in decoupled HER increases by 38.24% and OER by 29.82% during prolonged decoupled test. This study provides valuable insights into the impedance contributions and kinetic mechanisms through novel electrolysis approaches, guiding further optimization of decoupled electrolyzer and electrode.

AB  - Global-scale application of water-splitting technology for hydrogen fuel production and storage of intermittent renewable energy sources has called for the development of oxygen- and hydrogen-evolution catalysts that are inexpensive, efficient, robust, and can withstand frequent power interruptions and shutdowns. Here, we report the controlled electrodeposition of porous nickel iron hydrox-ylphosphate (NiFe-OH-PO4) nanobelts onto the surface of macroporous nickel foams (NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient whole-cell water electrolysis. The NiFeOH-PO4/NF electrode shows both high water oxidation and water reduction catalytic activity in alkaline solutions and is able to deliver current densities of 20 and 800 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of merely 249 and 326 mV for oxygen-evolution reaction, current densities of 20 and 300 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 135 and 208 mV for hydrogen-evolution reaction. Further, in a two-electrode water electrolytic cell, the bifunctional NiFe-OH-PO4/NF electrodes can obtain the current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) at an overall cell potential of only 1.68 and 1.91 V, respectively. Remarkably, the NiFe-OH-PO4(/)NF catalyst also represents prolonged stability under both continuous and intermittent electrolysis and can be used for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reversibly without degradation.

AB  - In the new "Hydrogen Economy" concept, water electrolysis is considered one of the most promising technologies for hydrogen production. Novel electrocatalytic materials for the hydrogen electrode are being actively investigated to improve the energy efficiency of current electrolysers. Platinum (Pt) alloys are known to possess good catalytic activities towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, virtually nothing is known about the effects of rare earth (RE) elements on the electrocatalytic behaviour of Pt towards the HER. In this study, the hydrogen discharge is evaluated in three different Pt RE intermetallic alloy electrodes, namely Pt-Ce, Pt-Sm and Pt Ho, all having equiatomic composition. The electrodes are tested in 8 M KOH aqueous electrolytes at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 85 degrees C. Measurements of the HER by linear scan voltammetry allow the determination of several kinetic parameters, namely the Tafel coefficients, charge-transfer coefficients, and exchange current densities. Activation energies of 46, 59, 39, and 60 kJ mol(-1) are calculated for Pt, Pt-Ce, Pt-Sm and Pt-Ho electrodes, respectively. Results show that the addition of REs improves the activity of the Pt electrocatalyst. Studies are in progress to correlate the microstructure of the studied alloys with their performance towards the HER. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work reports the revisited thermodynamic parameters of urea oxidation reaction CO(NH2) (2)+H2O -> N-2+3H(2)+CO2, which is used in the urea-assisted electrolytic cell for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. It has been repeatedly stated in the literature that the open-circuit voltage for this reaction is equal to 0.37 V, which is significantly less than in the case of hydrogen evolution with a coupled oxygen evolution reaction (1.23 V at 298 K). This feature is considered as a very important advantage of urea-assisted systems. Our calculations showed that the value of 0.37 V is erroneous, and the correct value of the open-circuit voltage is similar to 0.07 V. The specified thermodynamic parameters confirm the excellent prospects of electrochemical hydrogen production with the coupled reaction of urea oxidation and indicate wide potential opportunities for further reduction of energy consumption in the electrolysis process.

AB  - This protocol describes the synthesis and activity mapping of bi-metallic, MXenesupported cathodes for carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) and anodes for water splitting utilizing solar energy in alkaline media. A reverse current pulse electrodeposition technique was used to control the nanostructure, grain refinement, and alloy composition of the fabricated electrodes. Both anodes and cathodes are noble metalfree and supported on two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene, which reduces contact resistance and facilitates the charge transfer from substrate to reactants via catalysts. Copper zinc (CuZn) supported on Ti3C2Tx MXene are used as cathodes for methanol production in thermocatalytic CO2 conversion, and here we have demonstrated their performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) for the first time. Nickel cobalt (NiCo) supported on Ti3C2Tx MXene are similarly fabricated via pulse electrodeposition and tested as anodes for water electrolysis driven by a solar cell under simplified laboratory conditions. The activity also describes the structural characterization of metallic thin films. Detailed setup for the integration of the state-of-the-art perovskite silicon tandem solar cell with electrochemical cell, which in turn feeds in-line gas chromatography, is demonstrated for both CO2R and water electrolysis (WE).

AB  - Advanced treatment, such as tight membrane filtration and ion exchange, can be applied for Pb2+ removal from wastewater but these methods are expensive with a high demand for electric energy and chemicals. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are an emerging wastewater treatment technology and MECs can remove Pb2+ by reduction and precipitation at the cathode and biosorption at the anode; however, reduction at the anode has not been reported. We investigated Pb2+ removal mechanisms using lab-scale MECs. Using an anion exchange membrane, independent Pb2+ removal in the anode and cathode chambers was observed at various voltage applications, including open circuit, 0.3 V, 0.6 V, and 0.9 V. A substantial amount of metallic Pb (0. 10 +/- 0.02 mg) was found on the graphite fiber anode. Also, the observed anode potential (-0.15 to -0.33 V vs. SHE) indicated sufficient driving force for Pb2+ reduction at the anode for the Pb2+ concentration of 0.1 to 2.5 mg L-1. Inactivation of exoelectrogens using ethanol resulted in no Pb2+ removal. The findings show that Pb2+ removal is achieved by various mechanisms in MECs, including electrodeposition at the anode by exoelectrogens.

AB  - In this study, an energy storage device using a three-electrode battery is fabricated. The charging process takes place during electrolysis of the alkaline electrolyte where hydrogen is stored at the palladium bifunctional electrode. Upon discharging, power is generated by operating the alkaline fuel cell using hydrogen which is accumulated in the palladium hydride bifunctional electrode during the charging process. The bifunctional palladium electrode is prepared by electrodeposition using a hydrogen bubble template followed by a galvanic displacement reaction of platinum in order to functionalize the electrode to work not only as a hydrogen storage material but also as an anode in a fuel cell. This bifunctional electrode has a sufficiently high surface area and the platinum catalyst populates at the surface of electrode to operate the fuel cell. The charging and discharging performance of the three-electrode battery are characterized. In addition, the cycle stability is investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A non-precious-metal medium entropy sulfide (MES) embedded in sulfur-doped polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon fiber (SPAN-FCNM) has been successfully designed to maximize the synergistic effects among the atomically well-mixed constituents and exhibits superior trifunctional electrocatalytic performances toward the overall alkaline water electrolysis and oxygen reduction reactions. This catalyst achieves low overpotentials (& eta;) for the oxygen evolution reaction (& eta;10 = 210 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (& eta;10 = 55 mV) with a minor efficiency decay of 7.5% under 100-h continuous operation in 1 M KOH at 500 mA cm-2. In addition, a zinc-air battery with the SPAN-FCNM-coated air electrode exhibits an extraordinary energy efficiency (1st cycle = 60.9%; 90th cycle = 58.9%) at the industrially relevant discharge/charge current density of 50 mA cm-2 for over 60 h. Therefore, rational design to maximize the synergistic effects through atomically well-mixed composition, as realized in entropy-maximized materials, successfully demonstrates the breakthrough in the catalyst design.

AB  - The present work focuses on the use of two coaxial polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipes for the fabrication of an electrolyser. Fine perforations in the lower part of the inner pipe were made for easy movement of ions via electrolytic material between the electrodes. The two electrodes (anodes and cathodes) were kept in the outer and inner pipes respectively. A photovoltaic panel was directly connected to the electrolyser to measure the performance of the electrolyser system at normal room temperature and pressure with 27 wt% potassium hydroxide solution. Water displacement burette flow meter was used for measurement of flow rates of the produced hydrogen and oxygen. The effects of various operating parameters on hydrogen production, variation in open circuit voltage and short circuit current produced by the photovoltaic cell with solar intensity in the daytime and their effect on H-2 flow rate, and utilization of this hydrogen gas in the hydrogen gas stove need to be studied further. The work concludes with an innovative design to prepare a simple and cheap alkaline electrolyser to produce hydrogen gas using solar energy from the photovoltaic panel that can be used in remote areas for cooking purposes.

AB  - High efficient electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reac-tion (HER) are very critical to renewable energy technologies such as water splitting?rechargeable Zn-air battery. As a promising class of catalysts, the transition metal phosphide that are considered as promising substitutes to noble metal based catalysts.

AB  - Regenerative fuel cells are a potential candidate for future energy storage, but their applications are limited by the high cost and poor round-trip efficiency. Here we present a switchable pH-differential unitized regenerative fuel cell capable of addressing both the obstacles. Relying on a membraneless laminar flow-based design, pH environments in the cell are optimized independently for different electrode reactions and are switchable together with the cell process to ensure always favorable thermodynamics for each electrode reaction. Benefiting from the thermodynamic advantages of the switchable pH-differential arrangement, the cell allows water electrolysis at a voltage of 0.57 V, and a fuel cell open circuit voltage of 1.89 V, rendering round-trip efficiencies up to 74%. Under room conditions, operating the cell in fuel cell mode yields a power density of 1.3 W cm(-2), which is the highest performance to date for laminar flow-based cells and is comparable to state-of-the-art polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.

AB  - Realizing the potential of renewable hydrogen production requires flexible operation of electrolysis systems to integrate with intermittent power sources. This work develops an optimization model to assess flexible operational strategies for alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers powered by wind energy. The model quantitatively analyses trade-offs between electrolyser shutdown strategies, overloading capacities, and battery integration to identify optimal regimes balancing efficiency, flexibility, and economics. The results reveal a mixed-integer linear programming approach can optimize system configurations and control strategies to minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen production. Optimal near-minimum load operation is achieved by independently optimizing the load of each electrolyser block, while avoiding shutdowns above a critical load level. Strategic electrolyser overloading can provide economic benefits by reducing installed capital costs, if technical feasibility and accelerated degradation are addressed. Battery energy storage integration significantly improves economics by enhancing asset utilization, provided excess renewable energy is available. The model provides novel insights on integrating alkaline and PEM electrolysis with intermittent wind power to advance renewable hydrogen production. Quantifying trade-offs between operational flexibility and economics will help guide flexible design and control strategies for cost-optimal renewable electrolysis systems.

AB  - The substantial discharge of urea-rich wastewater presents a significant threat to the ecological environment. The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) represents an efficient and environmentally sustainable approach for urea degradation, with its low thermodynamic potential suggesting considerable potential to supplant the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in energy-efficient hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Although nickel-based catalysts show considerable promise for UOR, the high energy barrier associated with the formation of Ni3+ remains an obstacle for the reaction. Here, a Ru-doped NiP2 nanosheet array (NiP2-Ru) catalyst was constructed for UOR. The experimental results indicate that Ru doping modulates the local charge distribution of NiP2, thereby increasing the oxidation state of Ni. This modification facilitates the formation of highly active Ni3+ sites, which substantially enhances the UOR activity of NiP2. The NiP2-Ru catalyst demonstrates exceptional UOR performance, requiring an overpotential of only 0.95 and 0.99 V to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 with a low Tafel slope of 11.27 mV dec-1, respectively, in a 1 M KOH solution containing 0.33 M urea, which is comparable to the best reported UOR activity. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits an excellent stability for over 100 h. This research proposes a viable strategy for the design and synthesis of effective UOR electrocatalysts and advocates further exploration of the application of transition metal phosphides in various environmental and energy-related domains.

AB  - Additively manufactured (AM) nickel electrodes offer a great potential as an efficient solution for oxygen evolution catalysts in alkaline electrolyzers, since advanced fabrication methods allow the design of high surface area electrodes. The accurate determination of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is a key step in the evaluation of the intrinsic catalytic activity of complex electrodes. In this work, we fabricated Ni electrodes with different macroscopic lattice structures using laser powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M). The selected designs allow exploring the effects of the electrode geometry on the electrochemical performance. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) and a non-contact optical profilometer (NCOP) were used to investigate the composition and surface morphology of the electrodes. The ECSA was determined by three different approaches. 1. Linear and non-linear allometric fitting of the double layer capacitance from voltammetric experiments. 2. Integration of the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition, also from voltammetry. 3. Assessing double layer capacitance determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at open circuit potential (OCP) and the adsorption capacitance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates. Comparing these methods, large deviations in the resulting ECSAs were found, motivating a comprehensive discussion. In addition, four different reactions were investigated, ferri-ferrocyanide redox system, hydrogen evolution, ethanol electrooxidation, and oxygen evolution reaction. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of AM to tailor electrode performance by altering electrode geometry. The findings underline the importance of the ECSA determination for the comparison of the electrocatalytic activity in different electrodes.

AB  - The processes of corrosion and degradation of electrode materials are crucial for the efficiency of pulse electrolysis and are expected to depend on the electrical characteristics of the pulse (current/voltage, frequency, duty cycle). The aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of these characteristics on the electrochemical properties of Ti electrodes. Pulse electrolysis was carried out in 6 M KOH for 24 and 72 h with current amplitude of 65 mA, frequencies of the signal of 0.5-10 kHz and pulse duty cycle between 1 and 99%. The electrochemical properties of the titanium anode and cathode surfaces after operation were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a borate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at the open circuit potential, as well as by linear sweep voltammetry in a similar solution containing an equimolar mixture of K4Fe(CN)(6) and K3Fe(CN)(6) as a redox couple to probe the electronic conductivity of the surface films.

AB  - To achieve long-duration energy storage (LDES), a technological and economical battery technology is imperative. Herein, we demonstrate an all-around zinc-air flow battery (ZAFB), where a decoupled acid-alkaline electrolyte elevates the discharge voltage to -1.8 V, and a reaction modifier KI lowers the charging voltage to -1.8 V. This ZAFB exhibits a long discharge duration of over 4 h, a high power density of 178 mW cm-2 (about 76 % higher than conventional ZAFB), and unprecedented energy efficiency of nearly 100 %. Moreover, the ZAFB demonstrates outstanding fast charging ability, mitigated zinc dendrite growth and parasitic hydrogen evolution, enhanced cathode protection, and good resistance to environmental disturbance. This all-around ZAFB will not only become a very promising option for LDES but also promote the development of other LDES systems.

AB  - A novel approach to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) silver nanodomes (AgNDs) based on combination of soft lithography and nanosphere lithography was reported. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used for the characterization of the 3D nanostructures. The 3D-AgNDs were evaluated for electrochemical hydrogen production in 6 M KOH solution by some electrochemical techniques. It was found that well-structured AgNDs have higher hydrogen evolution activity than Ag bulk. The hydrogen discharge potential (EH2) at the NDs lowered similar to 150 mV with respect to that of the bulk Ag electrode which demonstrated that fabrication of NDs favors the hydrogen evolution kinetics and reduces the energy input for activating the HER. The cathodic Tafel slopes of bulk Ag and AgNDs were found to be 108 and 114 mV dec(-1), respectively. The related charge transfer coefficients were very close to 0.5. In the case of AgNDs, resistance was reduced from 660 to 197.1 Omega cm(2). This electrode was also characterized with higher current density at a fixed overpotential when compared to bulk Ag. The superior hydrogen evolution performance of AgNDs was assigned to their high roughness and large real surface area. Roughness factor (R-f) of the NDs was 22 times higher than that of bulk Ag.

AB  - The development of a powerful, cyclically stable and electrically rechargeable zinc-oxygen battery with a three-electrode configuration is reported. A copper foam was used as stable substrate for zinc deposition in flowing potassium hydroxide electrolyte, while oxygen reduction and evolution were accomplished by a commercial silver electrode and a nickel foam, respectively. The cell could be charged and discharged with up to 600 mA cm(-2), delivered a peak power density of 270 mWcm(-2), and performed for more than 600 cycles, although short circuits by dendrite formation could not yet be completely avoided. At a current density of 50mA cm(-2) and a temperature of 30 degrees C, a promising energy efficiency of 54% was achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Perovskite oxides are an emerging class of highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); however, their electrochemical stability remains poorly understood. Here, we report a systematic evaluation of the OER activity and stability of La1-xSrxFeO3-delta perovskites in 1 M KOH. Their initial OER activity first increases with increasing Sr content (from x = 0 to 0.8), and then decreases when the Sr content is increased to 1. Their stability evaluated by monitoring the element leaching from the electrodes show that La does not leach at a detectable rate, but Sr and Fe leach substantially. The leaching of Sr occurs at similar rates under open circuit potential (OCP) and OER potential, suggesting a nonelectrochemical dissolution process. The leaching of Fe is, however, strongly dependent on the electrode potential. More Fe leaching is observed under the OER potential than OCP. Additionally, the electrode with higher initial OER activity leaches more Fe. These results indicate that OER facilitates the dissolution of Fe from the electrode. The leaching of Fe, in turn, is considered responsible for the activity loss of La1-xSrxFeO3-delta during OER. This study brings new insight into the degradation mechanism of La1-xSrxFeO3-delta and their related perovskite oxides during electro-oxidation processes.

AB  - The effect of electrode area, electrolyte concentration, temperature, and light intensity (up to 218 sun) on PV electrolysis of water is studied using a high concentrated triple-junction (3-J) photovoltaic cell (PV) connected directly to an alkaline membrane electrolyzer (EC). For a given current, the voltage requirement to run an electrolyzer increases with a decrease in electrode sizes (4.5, 2.0, 0.5, and 0.25 cm(2)) due to high current densities. The high current density operation leads to high Ohmic losses, most probably due to the concentration gradient and bubble formation. The EC operating parameters including the electrolyte concentration and temperature reduce the voltage requirement by improving the thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport properties of the overall electrolysis process. For a direct PV-EC coupling, the maximum power point of PV (P-max) is matched using EC I-V (current-voltage) curves measured for different electrode sizes. A shift in the EC I-V curves toward open-circuit voltage (V-oc) reduces the P-op (operating power) to hydrogen efficiencies due to the increased voltage losses above the equilibrium water-splitting potential. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies remained comparable (similar to 16%) for all electrode sizes when the operating current (I-op) was similar to the short-circuit current (I-sc) irrespective of the operating voltage (V-op), electrolyzer temperature, and electrolyte concentration.

AB  - Herein, we report the development of a magnesium alloy (AZ31)-tungsten oxide (WO3) transient battery (TB) utilizing biodegradable tape as structural support. The battery comprises an Mg alloy anode, a WO3-coated Mo foil (WO3/Mo) cathode, and a sodium alginate with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) gel electrolyte. It delivers a charge capacity of 10.5 mAh/cm(2), an energy density of 13.96 mWh/cm(2), and an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V at a discharge current density of 0.05 mA/cm(2). The battery operates stably for similar to 8 days, though its performance declines threefold under higher discharge rates. It degrades almost completely in soil within six weeks. When integrated into a two-electrode water-splitting system, the battery successfully facilitates electrolysis, generating hydrogen and oxygen gases while inducing a pH shift from neutral to alkaline within ten minutes. These results highlight its potential for localized pH regulation in environmental settings, such as restoring ocean pH after oil spills, while also serving as a sustainable source of renewable hydrogen energy.

AB  - The oxygen evolution reaction at multi-cycled iron oxy-hydroxide films in aqueous alkaline solution is discussed. Steady-state Tafel plot analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slopes of ca. 60 mV dec (1) and 40 mV dec(-1) are found at low overpotentials depending on the oxide growth conditions, with an apparent Tafel slope of ca. 120 mV dec(-1) at high overpotentials. Reaction orders of ca. 0.5 and 1.0 are observed at low and high overpotentials, again depending on the oxide growth conditions. A mechanistic scheme involving the active participation of octahedrally coordinated anionic iron oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes, which form the porous hydrous layer, is proposed. The latter structure contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution. This work brings together current research in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and homogeneous molecular catalysis for water oxidation.

AB  - Pulse electrolysis was conducted in a 3 M KOH-0.21 M Na3PO4-0.15 M Al(NO3)3-0.6 M KF solution to form a corrosion-resistant coating on a cast AZ91D magnesium alloy. We investigated the effect of the pulse repetition frequency (2, 5, and 10 kHz) on the chemical composition, morphology, and corrosion performance of the coating. While the chemical compositions of the coatings were similar, the coating morphology varied with the repetition frequency. The coating on the 5 kHz specimen exhibited a thickness of up to approximately 46 mu m without delamination, whereas the coatings on the 2 and 10 kHz specimens were thinner. The coating on the 10 kHz specimen contained many cracks, and delamination from the alloy substrate was observed. In 0.01 M NaCl (pH 8.0), the open circuit potential of the 5 kHz specimen remained at approximately-0.2 V, even though that of the 2 and 10 kHz specimens oscillated at approximately-1.4 V. Potentiodynamic polarization tests revealed that the coating on the 5 kHz specimen inhibited both anodic and cathodic reactions, exhibiting a passive state from approximately-0.5 V to 0.5 V. The superior corrosion resistance of the 5 kHz specimen was attributed to the greater coating thickness and the absence of delamination from the substrate.

AB  - Renewable energy driven electrochemical processes are becoming increasingly important in the transition away from fossil fuels. One of the key reactions is electrochemical water splitting to generate green hydrogen which ideally could be directly integrated with a wind or solar electricity source. However, alkaline electrolysers suffer from significant degradation in performance if they are rapidly powered down under reduced sunlight conditions when directly coupled with a solar cell due to reverse current flow. In this work we address this issue by creating a truly bifunctional electrode material that is switchable between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis method is simple whereby a Pt electrode is electrochemically activated and then immersed in a nickel nitrate solution to electrolessly deposit Ni on the surface. When this electrode is electrochemically cycled, it creates an active Pt-Ni alloy at the Pt surface. Importantly, this electrocatalyst is switchable between both reactions without loss of activity as evidenced by an accelerated stress test over a 24 h period. An added advantage is that this Pt-Ni electrocatalyst is also more active than Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction which opens up its applicability in fuel cells. Finally, to demonstrate the multifunctionality of this Pt-Ni material, ethanol and ammonia oxidation is demonstrated which also shows better performance than Pt.

AB  - The development of an electrocatalyst with high performance using nonprecious metals/metal oxides as well as its applications in flexible and rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water electrolyzers is in strong demand from industries. In this study, we have designed and synthesized a new (Fe3NiS8-delta)(-4+delta) carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid electrocatalyst and revealed that the catalyst shows a very high oxygen evolution reaction (1.55 V at 10 mA/cm(2)) and oxygen reduction reaction (E-1/2 = 0.82 V vs RHE) performances. Based on the analyses by in situ electrochemical X-ray diffraction together with structure analysis software, in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and computer simulations, such a high performance is derived from the sulfur vacancies that were formed via the self-doped d-p orbitals of Fe-III in (Fe3NiS8-delta)(-4+delta). Here, we describe an adequate explanation about the role of the iron doping in the nickel sulfides in the catalyst. Furthermore, the fabricated flexible and rechargeable Zn-air and water electrolyzer batteries using the catalyst show a low charge-discharge overpotential gap of 0.66 V and a 237 mA/cm(2) current density at 1.9 V, which is very important for the development of a rechargeable Zn-air battery and water electrolyzer with a high performance. First-principles calculations are employed to investigate the reaction mechanisms and elucidate the effect of the CNT support for the catalytic activity.

AB  - A composite catalyst with a novel construction of bimetallic phosphide FeNiP nanoparticles embedded in an N,P double-doped carbon matrix was prepared. It was demonstrated to be a trifunctional catalyst that can efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It was found that the introduction of oleylamine during the preparation can adjust the catalytic sites and finally lead to ideal catalytic performances. The obtained catalyst exhibited efficient ORR catalytic performance that surpassed the commercial Pt/C catalyst, with the OER performance comparable to that of RuO2 as well as excellent HER performance. The ORR half-wave potential is 0.879 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, while the OER overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 280 mV in 1 M KOH solution. The potential gap between the ORR and OER was only 0.700 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. This trifunctional catalyst was further evaluated in energy devices including zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis. The liquid zinc-air battery assembly achieved a power density of 169 mW cm(-2) and stably undergoes charge-discharge cycles for 210 hours. The solid-state zinc-air battery achieved a power density of 70 mW cm(-2) and stably undergoes charge-discharge cycles for 40 hours. These performances surpassed the batteries assembled with a Pt/C-RuO2 mixed catalyst. This work established a foundation of composite catalysts coupled with bimetallic phosphide and hybrid carbon substrates, which will promote the development of high-performance multifunctional catalysts and their application in energy devices.

AB  - As a step toward developing robust and highly active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we have developed a polydopamine-derived iron-doped hollow carbon nanorod (FeHCNR). It exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the HER in acidic media with an overpotential of 29.4 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm-2. The catalyst also displays efficient activity for the ORR in acidic media with a high onset potential of 0.97 V. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the HER characteristics, we designed a new type of Zn-H2 hybrid battery for the simultaneous generation of hydrogen and electricity by asymmetric electrolysis with the acid catholyte and alkaline anolyte. The system displayed an open circuit voltage of 1.28 V along with good stability compared to that of the one built using the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This device could generate H2 gas with a Faradaic efficiency of 97% along with the generation of electricity. Moreover, the outstanding ORR activity of the FeHCNR could be validated by demonstrating an asymmetric-electrolyte Zn-air battery by employing the catalyst as the cathode, which provided an open-circuit voltage of 2.15 V and a power density of 69 mW cm-2 with the contribution of the electrochemical neutralization energy along with Zn oxidation. Thus, the FeHCNR could perform well toward the HER and ORR during the system-level demonstrations, and this advantage is mainly credited to the hollow nanorod structure of the catalyst, which provides better exposure of the active sites along the outer and inner walls of the system to facilitate the concerned reactions. The open-tube cavity structure of the FeHCNR is supportive for the simultaneous diffusion of the electrolyte and reactants along with more facile dissipation of the products.

AB  - The development of high-performance energy materials is essential for addressing global energy challenges. In this study, a NiO@CoZnLDH composite electrode was synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal process, and its electrochemical performance was evaluated for applications in both supercapacitors and water electrolysis. The asymmetric supercapacitor (NiO@CoZnLDH//AC) achieved an energy density of 9.44 Wh/kg at a power density of 1132 W/kg, maintaining 73.6% of its capacitance after 8000 charge-discharge cycles. For electrocatalysis, the composite exhibits low overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (188.8 and 322.2 mV at 10 mA/ cm2) and enables stable overall water splitting at 1.84 V for 12 h in 1 M KOH. These results confirm that NiO@CoZnLDH is a promising bifunctional material for energy storage and conversion applications.

AB  - Electrodialysis as one of separation technology has proven high efficiency in wastewater treatment, but most of the intended studies did not take into consideration the allowable level of outlet dilute discharge. In addition, the concentrated discharge should to be treated. The disposal of Pb2+ containing solutions must comply with the established legal maximum level of 1 mg L-1. In order to achieve this target, solutions of Pb(NO3((2) were treated using a combination of electrodialysis (ED), electrolysis (EL), and adsorption on a cation exchange membrane (CEM). The Taguchi approach was utilized to identify the optimal levels of influential parameters in the ED and EL processes. The ED process reduced the Pb2+ concentration from 600 mg L-1 to 15-17 mg L-1 in the ED dilute solution, while Pb2+ was increased in the concentrated solution to 2600-3000 mg L-1. The concentrated solution was electrolyzed to yield a 90-91% recovery of Pb2+ deposits. The concentration of the dilute solution was further reduced to 1.0-1.3 mg L-1 and 1.4-1.9 mg L-1 for the outlet streams by circulation inside a second ED unit to provide membrane adsorption. The associated NO3--N concentration was reduced during ED and EL treatments through separation in the anion exchange membrane (AEM) and losses in the form of gas evolution. The outlet NO3--N concentration was below the permissible level of 50 mg L-1, and there was no need for further treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accessing the electrode-electrolyte interface under operating conditions and capturing time-resolved kinetics remain challenging in electrochemical studies. Copper's interfacial oxidation dynamics remain unclear despite extensive research. Modulation excitation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ME-XAS) was used to probe Cu in 100 mM KHCO3 with sub-second sensitivity, revealing that hydroxide forms 30 +/- 10 ms before the appearance of Cu2O at positive potentials (0 to 0.5 V vs. RHE) near open-circuit conditions. From -0.4 to 0.8 V vs. RHE, hydroxide coverage reaches 49%, accompanied by a balanced presence of Cu(i) and Cu(ii) oxides. These insights into Cu interfacial redox behavior under intermittent renewable energy operation-relevant to CO2 electrolyzer durability-enhance our fundamental understanding of electrochemical interfaces.

AB  - An electrolyte supported solid oxide cell of 45 cm(2) area was operated in the steam electrolysis mode during more than 23,000 h before scheduled shutdown, of which 20,000 h with a current density of j = -0.9 A cm(-2). The cell consisted of a scandia/ceria doped zirconia electrolyte (6Sc1CeSZ), CGO diffusion-barrier/adhesion layers between electrolyte and electrodes, a lanthanum strontium cobaltite ferrite (LSCF) oxygen electrode, and a nickel/gadolinia-doped ceria (Ni/GDC) steam/hydrogen electrode. Voltage degradation in the operation period with j = -0.9 A cm(-2) was 7.4 mV/1000 h (0.57%/1000 h) and the increase in the area specific resistance 8 m Omega cm(2)/1000 h. The final cell voltage was 1.33 V (at 851 degrees C cell temperature). After dismantling, the cell showed no mechanical damage at electrolyte and H-2/H2O electrode; a small fraction of the oxygen electrode was delaminated. Impedance spectroscopy applied at the steady state DC current density confirmed a degradation dominated by an increasing ohmic term, mainly due to ionic conductivity decay in the electrolyte. In addition, a small non-ohmic and at least partly reversible 02 electrode contribution to degradation was identified, affected by a pollution from the (compressor) purge air.

AB  - Alkaline seawater electrolysis powered by intermittent renewable energy offers a promising pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet faces critical challenges in proton supply dynamics and catalyst stability. The dual limitations are addressed through the design of a Cr-NiCoPv@NF (Pv: P vacancy, NF: nickel foam) electrocatalyst featuring frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). The metal-phosphorus FLP architecture demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 110 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and 333 mV at an industrial-grade current density of 1 A cm-2 in a 1.0 m KOH + seawater electrolyte. Key innovation lies in the system's dynamic stability to intermittent operation, maintaining approximate to 100% activity after 520 h at 0.5 A cm-2 with 12 h start-shutdown cycles. Combined experimental and theoretical analyzes reveal two crucial mechanisms: 1) FLPs synergistically facilitate H & horbar;OH bond dissociation (0.18 eV barrier reduction) and optimize hydrogen desorption energetics (0.13 eV barrier reduction), solving the proton supply limitation. 2) The selective adsorption behavior enables surface-enriched OH- groups to form a molecular-level protective shield that repels chlorides through electrostatic effects, effectively mitigating catalyst corrosion. This work establishes a new paradigm for non-precious metal catalyst design via targeted electronic structure engineering, while providing fundamental insights into the interfacial microenvironment under intermittent operations.

AB  - Achieving stable and efficient hydrogen production via large-scale alkaline electrolysis under fluctuating renewable energy remains a major challenge, primarily due to overlooked electrolyzer startup thresholds and runtime imbalance among stacks in conventional scheduling strategies. These issues often lead to energy curtailment, equipment degradation, and operational risks. The authors' previous work combined segmented power allocation with periodic cycling, improving performance but lacking real-time adaptability and optimal coordination between hydrogen production and load balancing. Building on this, this study proposes a dynamic scheduling strategy (CS4) that integrates a segmented dispatch algorithm-enhancing energy capture by aligning power input with electrolyzer startup thresholds-with a simulated annealing (SA)-based optimization approach. A binary-variable, state-aware model represents electrolyzer transitions among production, standby, and shutdown states, enabling responsive control under variable wind input. CS4 establishes a closed-loop framework to balance load, extend equipment life, and improve efficiency. Simulations over 250 days using real wind data show that CS4 increases hydrogen output by 5.36 %, reduces runtime deviation by 99.82 %, and improves lifecycle total profit by 10.48 % compared to baseline strategies. Its verification of the robustness and scalability across system sizes confirms CS4 as a robust, adaptive, and lifecycle-conscious solution for intelligent hydrogen production under intermittent renewables.

AB  - Electrolysis that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to useful chemicals can, in principle, contribute to a more sustainable and carbon-neutral future(1,2,3,4,5,6). However, it remains challenging to develop this into a robust process because efficient conversion typically requires alkaline conditions in which CO2 precipitates as carbonate, and this limits carbon utilization and the stability of the system(7,8,9,10,11,12). Strategies such as physical washing, pulsed operation and the use of dipolar membranes can partially alleviate these problems but do not fully resolve them(11,13,14,15). CO2 electrolysis in acid electrolyte, where carbonate does not form, has therefore been explored as an ultimately more workable solution(16,17,18). Herein we develop a proton-exchange membrane system that reduces CO2 to formic acid at a catalyst that is derived from waste lead-acid batteries and in which a lattice carbon activation mechanism contributes. When coupling CO2 reduction with hydrogen oxidation, formic acid is produced with over 93% Faradaic efficiency. The system is compatible with start-up/shut-down processes, achieves nearly 91% single-pass conversion efficiency for CO2 at a current density of 600 mA cm(-2) and cell voltage of 2.2 V and is shown to operate continuously for more than 5,200 h. We expect that this exceptional performance, enabled by the use of a robust and efficient catalyst, stable three-phase interface and durable membrane, will help advance the development of carbon-neutral technologies.

AB  - To maximize the profit of the on-grid wind-hydrogen conversion system, an adaptive operating strategy optimization method based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed and verified in this study. The electrolyzer state transition model is applied to describe the production, standby, and shutdown states, thus the algorithm can arrange the electrolyzer operation adaptively without human intervention. The dynamic degradation model is integrated in the algorithm, which is correlated to the operating condition of the alkaline electrolyzer (AE), including load fluctuation and stop-start circles. The proposed method is verified in 4 typical scenarios of different seasons, where the wind power and electricity price fluctuation modes are totally different. The operation corresponds well with the ideal situation. The electrolysis system is set to full load when the electricity price is low to produce the most hydrogen. On the contrary, when the electricity is high, the power of the electrolysis system is turned low and even stopped, to sell as much electricity as possible to the grid. The standby and shutdown modes of the electrolyzer can be automatically chosen according to the stop duration, thus saving maintenance costs. Compared to the fixed load strategy, the proposed optimization method can increase the system profit by 2.32-5.26 percent.

AB  - In this work, hybrid materials based on polyelectrolyte complexes of chitosan with cobalt and nickel oxy-compounds on the stainless steel surface were obtained using the non-stationary electrolysis method. Morphology, structure and elemental composition of the hybrid materials were studied. The X-ray phase analysis method allowed us to find that the main phase of the obtained hybrid materials is cobalt hydroxyisocyanate Co (OCN)(0.6)(OH)(1.4)(H2O)(0.6). The electrochemical characteristics of the hybrid materials obtained were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) in an alkaline electrolyte. The specific capacitance was 479 F.g(-1) at the current density of 1 A.g(-1). The calculated energy density and power density of the cell was 0.055 W.h.kg(-1) and 116 W.kg(-1), respectively. The results of long-term cycling allow us to conclude that the hybrid material is characterized by sufficient stability with capacity retention up to 85% after 5000 cycles.

AB  - Sulphonated poly-ether-ether-ketone porous diaphragms were prepared by immersion precipitation using chemically induced phase separation to obtain a tight diaphragm skin layer and underneath finger-like bulk morphology. Different variables including sulphonation degree, diaphragm thickness, precipitation temperature and the presence of an inorganic filler were analyzed in order to evaluate the performance of the resulting diaphragms in water alkaline electrolysis using a bipolar electrolyzer and a commercial scale (50 kW) electrolyzer stack. Their performance was compared with a commercially available diaphragm in terms of cell voltage and oxygen purity (HTO) under normal operation conditions (10 bar, 80 degrees C) and under transient operation with up to 80 shutdown cycles (a total of 20 days in operation). Long term stability and operation reliability were assured for the SPEEK diaphragms showing lower cell voltage and HTO than the ones obtained with the commercial Zirfon (R) HIP 500 diaphragm.

AB  - The development of efficient hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) and water-splitting electrocatalysts was considered critical for advancing clean energy technologies. In this study, platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru) were incorporated into copper zeolitic imidazolate framework (CuZIF) using an electroless plating method. Comprehensive characterization through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of pristine CuZIF and the metallic-incorporated Pt@CuZIF and Ru@CuZIF. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) to evaluate the catalytic activity of the prepared materials in water electrolysis for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as in HFC testing. Pt@CuZIF demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity for both HER and OER, with Tafel slopes of 118 and 118.5 mV dec-1, respectively, suggesting a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, and overpotentials of 345 and 474 mV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further revealed that both HER and OER benefited from Pt@CuZIF due to its low charge transfer resistance and high capacitance value. HFC measurements showed that Pt@CuZIF exhibited excellent performance and stability, with a discharge voltage of 0.13 V, an energy density of 68.42 Wh kg-1, and a power density of 205.26 W kg-1. In comparison, Ru@CuZIF exhibited a discharge voltage of 0.17 V, an energy density of 90.91 Wh kg-1, and a power density of 272.73 W kg-1. Overall, Pt@CuZIF was considered the most promising material for application in both water electrolysis and HFCs.

AB  - Advancements in cost-effective, high-performance alkaline water-splitting systems are crucial for the hydrogen industry. While the significance of electrode material design has been widely acknowledged, the practical implementation of these advancements remains challenging. In this study, we focused on the holistic design of the electrolysis system and successfully developed a novel alkaline water-splitting electrolyzer. The unique configuration of our electrolyzer allows the designed NiFe-LDH/carbon cloth gas diffusion anode to interact solely with the PVA-based gel membrane and air, enabling the direct discharge of oxygen into the gas phase. This innovative feature accelerates anode bubble overflow, reduces gas interference, and decreases the system impedance by minimizing electrode spacing. As a result, by utilizing the NiFeSn-alloy/nickel mesh cathode, our electrolyzer achieves a high current density of 308 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 2.0 V and demonstrates exceptional stability over 1000 h.

AB  - The oxygen evolution reaction at multi-cycled iron oxy-hydroxide films in aqueous alkaline solution is discussed. The factors affecting the growth and electrocatalytic properties of the latter are described. In particular, steady-state Tafel plot analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution. Tafel slopes of ca. 60 mV dec(-1) and 40 mV dec(-1) are found at low overpotentials depending on the oxide growth conditions, with an apparent Tafel slope of ca. 120 mV dec(-1) at high overpotentials. Reaction orders of ca. 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 are observed at low and high overpotentials, again depending on the oxide growth conditions. A mechanistic scheme involving the active participation of octahedrally coordinated anionic iron oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes, which form the porous hydrous layer, is proposed. The latter structure contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution. This work brings together current research in both heterogeneous electrocatalysis and homogeneous molecular catalysis for water oxidation. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - AM50 magnesium alloy is treated by PEO process using four different electrolytes which are combination of K(3)PO(4) and Na(3)PO(4) plus two different hydroxides, i.e. KOH and NaOH. Basic properties of the electrolyte such as pH, conductivity and breakdown voltage were measured. Moreover, coatings were characterised by scanning electron microscopy for the surface morphology and cross sectional study, X-ray diffraction for determination of phase composition and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for evaluation of corrosion resistance. The results indicate that KOH solutions need higher breakdown voltage and result in higher thickness of coatings. The values of the latter parameters are in the range of 150-160 V and 14-17 mu m respectively. While those of NaOH solutions are in the range of 106-116 V and 5-6 mu m thick. The final results show that presence of KOH in the solutions leads to a better corrosion performance of the coating compared to NaOH.

AB  - Herein, we report molten salts derived, cube-shaped CuWO4 nanoparticles (50 +/- 5 nm) as multi-functional catalysts in electrochemical and photo-electrochemical studies. The formation of pure phase cube-shaped CuWO4 nanoparticles (CWO-NPs) is analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM and FE-TEM). CWO-NPs show remarkable bifunctional electro-catalytic behavior for the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. Polarization studies of CWO-NPs exhibit low over-potential (similar to 260 mV) at 1 mA/cm(2) and low Tafel slope value (similar to 190 mV/dec) for OER compared to bulk or other oxides. Polarization studies with controlled electrode rotation reveal a four-electron pathway for the water electrolysis reaction for OER/ORR. In addition, CWO-NPs show promising capacitive behavior with specific capacitance values of similar to 230 F/g using 1 M KOH electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) studies of CWO-NPs displays low energy loss during discharge time for 50 segments. To further investigate the potential for industrial applications, the stability of the electrodes is also examined using chrono-amperometry (CA) at fixed potential, chronopotentiometry (CP) at fixed current density, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) with 50 cycles.

AB  - Development of electrocatalytic materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is attempted with the aim of reducing the water electrolysis overpotential and increasing its efficiency. Using linear scan voltammetry measurements of the hydrogen discharge enables evaluation of the electrocatalytic activity for the HER of platinum-dysprosium (Pt-Dy) intermetallic alloy electrodes of different compositions. Understanding of materials electrocatalytic performance is based on determination of several crucial kinetic parameters, including the Tafel coefficients, b, charge transfer coefficients, alpha, exchange current densities, j(0), and activation energies, E-a. Influence of temperature on HER is investigated by performing studies at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 85 degrees C. The effect of the Dy amount in the efficiency of the HER on the Pt-Dy alloys is analysed. Results demonstrate that Dy can substantially increase the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt alloys, in comparison to the single Pt electrode. Efforts are made to correlate the microstructure of the alloys with their performance towards the HER. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reports an electrocatalyst derived from multi-valent Mo4O11 nanosheets coupled Co-Ni (CN) nanowires (NW) (denoted as CN@Mo4O11) with improved catalytic coherency for both high-performance seawater splitting and Zn-seawater battery. The CN@Mo4O11 material significantly enhances the catalytical activity with a low overpotential of 63 mV/69 mV for hydrogen evolution and 100 mV/120 mV for oxygen evolution, respectively, to attain 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in alkaline freshwater/seawater. An electrolyzer cell of CN@Mo4O11(+,-) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.40 V/1.44 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) during alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting with an excellent performance retention of 98.6 %/97.6 % after a long-term operation for 50 h. The solar cell coupled electrolyzer also delivers a high solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 15.54 %/16.1 % in alkaline freshwater/seawater. A Zn-seawater battery based on CN@Mo4O11 cathode also delivers high current and power densities of 82 mA center dot cm(-2) and 27.6 mW center dot cm(-2), respectively, with a stable discharge time of 40 h. The CN@Mo4O11 heterostructure imparts favorable density of states and optimized adsorption energy for HER and OER, as deduced from DFT calculations, leading to improved overall catalytic performance and corrosion resistance in seawater. Results of this work clearly prove that this proposed catalyst architecture indeed has a huge potential for both seawater splitting and Zn-seawater battery fabrication.

AB  - Electrochemical water splitting powered by renewable energy (e.g. solar, wind) has been recognized as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way to produce "green" hydrogen. Significant efforts were dedicated recently to developing cheap and efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts to make electrolyzed hydrogen economically competitive. Notwithstanding substantial progress, the operational voltage of water splitting in a single electrolyte system is still high, even highly efficient electrocatalysts are used to catalyze the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Taking into account that the HER and the OER are kinetically favorable in electrolytes with different pH values, in this work we demonstrate that overall water splitting can be accomplished in acid-alkaline dual electrolytes with an onset voltage as low as 1.13 V, enabled by a bipolar membrane (BPM) under the "reverse bias" condition with the novel dual-phase cobalt phosphide-cobalt ditelluride (CoP-CoTe2) nanowires being used as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, we show that using a BPM under the "forward bias" the voltages needed to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) can be reduced to 1.01 and 1.37 V, respectively, due to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization resulting from the crossover of electrolytes. The bipolar membrane water electrolysis (BPMWE) can be sustained for at least 100 h without notable degradation.

AB  - Harnessing surplus wind and solar energy for water electrolysis boosts the efficiency of renewable energy utilization and supports the development of a low-carbon energy framework. However, the intermittent and unpredictable nature of wind and solar power generation poses significant challenges to the dynamic stability and hydrogen production efficiency of electrolyzers. This study introduces a multi-state rotational control strategy for a hybrid electrolyzer system designed to produce hydrogen. Through a detailed examination of the interplay between electrolyzer power and efficiency-along with operational factors such as load range and startup/shutdown times-six distinct operational states are categorized under three modes. Taking into account the differing dynamic response characteristics of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL) and alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), a power-matching mechanism is developed to optimize the performance of these two electrolyzer types under varied and complex conditions. This mechanism facilitates coordinated scheduling and seamless transitions between operational states within the hybrid system. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional sequential startup and shutdown approach, the proposed strategy increases hydrogen production by 10.73% for the same input power. Moreover, it reduces the standard deviation and coefficient of variation in operating duration under rated conditions by 27.71 min and 47.04, respectively, thereby enhancing both hydrogen production efficiency and the dynamic operational stability of the electrolyzer cluster.

AB  - Efficient and stable CO2-to-CO electrolyzers are key process components for the generation of green synthesis gas and its downstream conversion and valorization to carbonaceous e-chemicals and e-fuels. While alkaline CO2 electrolyzers suffer from low CO2 utilization due to cathodic carbonate formation and crossover, acidic CO2 electrolyzers suffer from low CO faradaic efficiency. Reverse-bias bipolar membrane (BPM) cell architectures have been proposed to promote cathodic proton transport, yet resulted in limited cell lifetimes due to complex degradation and failure regimes. A thorough diagnosis of BPM cell dynamics is missing to date. Here, we build and diagnose an efficient zero-gap reverse-bias BPM CO2-to-CO electrolyzer cell deploying CO-selective single Ni atom cathode catalysts. We analyzed its key cell performance parameters and diagnosed the cell stability and failure regimes over 100 hours. The electrolyzer cell showed excellent performance up to 500 mA cm-2 with CO faradaic efficiency near 100%. The proton-controlled ion transport in the cathode was directly confirmed by an experimental carbon cross-over coefficient (CCC) of zero, suggesting minimal carbon loss due to carbonate formation. This was coupled to a high single pass conversion of similar to 70% at the largest current densities and 60 vol% CO in the cell outlet, ideally suited for process cascade involving electro- or thermal catalytic steps. While use of a N2 bleed for internal reference has been known to be critical for accurate evaluation of cell performance, we now propose the experimental N2 vol% in the combined cell outlet and bleed flow to be also a valuable diagnostic tool to recognize and analyze cell failure regimes.

AB  - The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis remains a significant challenge for developing high-efficiency electrocatalytic systems. In this study, we present a three-dimensional, micrometer-sized iridium oxide (IrO2)-decorated cobalt carbonate hydroxide (IrO2-P-CoCH) electrocatalyst, which is engineered in situ on a carbon cloth (CC) substrate pretreated with atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma (PCC). The electrocatalyst features petal-like structures composed of nanosized rods, providing abundant reactive areas and sites, including the oxygen vacancy caused by the air-DBD plasma. As a result, the IrO2-P-CoCH/PCC electrocatalyst demonstrates an outstanding OER performance, with overpotentials of only 190 and 300 mV required to achieve current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)) and 300 mA cm(-2) (j(300)), respectively, along with a low Tafel slope of 48.1 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Remarkably, benefiting from rich active sites exposed on the IrO2-P-CoCH (Ir) heterostructure, the synergistic effect between IrO2 and CoCH enhances the charge delivery rates, and the IrO2-P-CoCH/PCC exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity at a high current density (300 mV/j(300)) compared to the commercial benchmarked RuO2/PCC (470 mV/j(300)). Furthermore, the IrO2-P-CoCH/PCC electrocatalyst shows exceptional OER stability, with a mere 1.3% decrease with a current density of j(10) for 100 h testing, surpassing most OER catalysts based on CC substrates. This work introduces a novel approach for designing high-performance OER electrocatalysts on flexible electrode substrates.

AB  - The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted more attention in recent time due to its wide applications in electrochemical energy transformation such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, electrolyzers, and wastewater treatment. However, the development of inexpensive and highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts is still a great challenge. Herein, FeS2-carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite was fabricated and deposited on a glassy car -bon electrode (GCE) surface to inspect the electrocatalytic ORR in an alkaline medium. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to characterize the FeS2- CNT/GCE surface. The EIS and open circuit potential (OCP) analysis showed that the FeS2-CNT/GCE has excel-lent catalytic effects compared to a bare GCE. Kinetic investigations revealed that the ORR occurred through a consecutive reaction pathway accompanied by a fast electron transfer step and controlled by a diffusion-limited process. Analysis of hydrodynamic voltammograms confirmed that the oxygen molecules undergo a 2e- transfer irreversible redox process and HO ⠁ 2 is generated as an intermediate before converting into hydroxide as the final product. The standard rate constant was calculated to be 2.5 x 10-7 cms-1 and the reaction followed first order kinetics.

AB  - Water electrolysis using non-precious transition metal-based electrocatalysts is one of the most promising ways for renewable hydrogen energy. Herein, we develop high-performance catalysts of trimetallic sulfide (Ni3S2-FeS-CoS) nanosheets decorated with bimetallic-nitroxide (NiCo(N,O)(x)) nanodots on a 3D NiFeCo foam by in situ fabrication with approaches of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and hydrothermal sulphurization. The resulting catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting in alkaline medium, with the overpotentials 82 m V for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 170 m V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)), which are very competitive to most recent non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. Specially, the nanodots help achieve ultra-stable electrocatalytic performance evidenced by negligible changes for the physico-chemical structure of catalyst after a harsh HER or OER test over 50 h. Our results offer a versatile approach for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts for hydrogen economy and other applications.

AB  - Applying a voltage to metal electrodes in contact with aqueous electrolytes results in the electrolysis of water at voltages above the decomposition voltage and plasma formation in the electrolyte at much higher voltages referred to as contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE). While several studies explore parameters that lead to changes in the I-U characteristics in this voltage range, little is known about the evolution of the structural properties of the electrodes. Here we study this aspect on materials essential to electrocatalysis, namely Pt, Au, and Cu. The stationary I-U characteristics are almost identical for all electrodes. Detailed structural characterization by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical approaches reveal that Pt is stable during electrolysis and CGDE, while Au and Cu exhibit a voltage-dependent oxide formation. More importantly, oxides are reduced when the Au and Cu electrodes are kept in the electrolysis solution after electrolysis. We suspect that H2O2 (formed during electrolysis) is responsible for the oxide reduction. The reduced oxides (which are also accessible via electrochemical reduction) form a porous film, representing a possible new class of materials in energy storage and conversion studies.

AB  - Engineering high-performance and low-cost bifunctional catalysts for H-2 (hydrogen evolution reaction [HER]) and O-2 (oxygen evolution reaction [OER]) evolution under industrial electrocatalytic conditions remains challenging. Here, for the first time, we use the stronger electronegativity of a rare-Earth yttrium ion (Y3+) to induce in situ NiCo-layered double-hydroxide nanosheets from NiCo foam (NCF) treated by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma NCF (PNCF), and then obtain nitrogen-doped YNiCo phosphide (N-YNiCoP/PNCF) after the phosphating process using radiofrequency plasma in nitrogen. The obtained N-YNiCoP/PNCF has a large specific surface area, rich heterointerfaces, and an optimized electronic structure, inducing high electrocatalytic activity in HER (331 mV vs. 2000 mA cm(-2)) and OER (464 mV vs. 2000 mA cm(-2)) reactions in 1 M KOH electrolyte. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the coordination number of CoNi decreased with the incorporation of Y atoms, which induce much shorter bonds of Ni and Co ions and promote long-term stability of N-YNiCoP in HER and OER under the simulated industrial conditions. Meanwhile, the CoN-YP5 heterointerface formed by plasma N-doping is the active center for overall water splitting. This work expands the applications of rare-Earth elements in engineering bifunctional electrocatalysts and provides a new avenue for designing high-performance transition-metal-based catalysts in the renewable energy field.

AB  - Sustainable and renewable production of hydrogen by water electrolysers is expected to be one of the most promising methods to satisfy the ever-growing demand for renewable energy production and storage. Hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte is still challenging due to its slow kinetic properties. This study proposes new nanoelectrode arrays for high Faradaic efficiency of the electro-sorption reaction of hydrogen in an alkaline electrolyte. A comparative study of the nanoelectrode arrays, consisting of platinum or palladium or bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) Pt80Pd20 (wt.%), obtained by nanosecond pulsed laser ablation in aqueous environment, casted onto graphene paper, is proposed. The effects of thin films of perfluoro-sulfonic ionomer on the material morphology, nanoparticles dispersion, and electrochemical performance have been investigated. The NPs-GP systems have been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Faradaic efficiency up to 86.6% and hydrogen storage capacity up to 6 wt.% have been obtained by the Pt-ionomer and Pd/Pt80Pd20 systems, respectively.

AB  - A research conducted to produce zinc powder through electrolysis of alkaline solutions by using various concentrations of KOH and zincate in the bath. Different current densities were applied for each concentration and then, morphological changes of Zn powder batches were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Afterward, an anode electrode was produced from each pack of powder. Thirty-six Zn-AgO battery cells were prepared totally. Discharge parameters of the cells were examined and time-voltage curves were analyzed. Discharge times were investigated for various conditions of Zn deposition and the proper terms were suggested. It has been seen that increase of KOH concentration and decrease of zincate ion in the bath solution will change the zinc morphology and increase the resultant battery discharge time. The longest time of discharge, before reduction of cell voltage to 1.25 V. was 7.91 min. This result was obtained for Zn powder produced in zincate concentration of 0.5 M, KOH concentration of 11 M and current density of 2500 A/m(2). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Uninterrupted H-2 production from water electrolysis powered by sunlight is critical for the development of hydrogen economy. The key to realize this purpose is to construct integrated devices involving energy storage and water splitting and corresponding efficient electrocatalysts, which remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a new type of solar hydrogen production integrated device using rechargeable zinc-air battery as energy storage media and energy driven device and alkaline water electrolyzer as the H-2 production terminal, wherein highly active FeNi phosphide-carbon hybrid materials prepared from the organophosphonic acid modified polyaniline polymer were employed as advanced electrode catalysts for the trifunctional HER/OER/ORR to improve device efficiency. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the hetero-engineering between FeNi phosphide and carbon modulates the d-band center, thereby improving the adsorption of intermediates during reactions. Further, the fabricated zinc-air battery with metal phosphide-based catalyst as an air cathode displays large power density (117 mW cm(-2)), excellent charge-discharge capability (voltage gap of 0.74 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), and outstanding cycling stability (over 500 h). The assembled water splitting electrolyzer also delivers low overpotentials (1.67 V at 20 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability. Furthermore, two zinc-air batteries in series powered the overall water-splitting cell achievingan average H-2 production rate of 0.24 mL min(-1), demonstrating significant prospects for H-2 production. Ultimately, this integrated water electrolysis device exhibited excellent stability in 15 day tests with the commercial silicon photovoltaic cell as the power source by day and the rechargeable zinc-air batteries provide electricity at night, without any decay in the performance. This work may provide new opportunities for low-cost and uninterruptible solar hydrogen production by constructing integrated devices.

AB  - This paper addresses the lack of comprehensive models and effective management strategies for hybrid electrolyzer arrays consisting of alkaline electrolyzers (ALKEL) and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), which are critical to optimizing the performance of wind-hydrogen systems. To this end, we develop electro-thermal models for both ALKEL and PEMEL, incorporating key operational factors such as state switching, hydrogen production, load balancing, and thermal management. These models are experimentally validated to ensure their accuracy. Building on these models, we propose a novel adaptive state-switching rolling optimization strategy that considers system efficiency, wind curtailment, cold/hot start frequencies, and temperature variations. In comparison, we also evaluate two conventional strategies: simple on/off control and periodic rotation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed strategy increases hydrogen production by 10.52 %- 14.78 %, reduces production time variation by up to 73.04 %, and improves load balancing and temperature stability. Over a full annual operational cycle, the proposed strategy yields the highest system efficiency, minimizes startup/shutdown frequency, and optimizes load factors. Specifically, it increases hydrogen production by 12.2 %-28.9 % and reduces the wind curtailment rate to 1.71 %. This study provides both theoretical models and practical management strategies to enhance the efficient operation of hybrid electrolyzer-based wind-hydrogen systems.

AB  - NiO nanoparticles of 70, 91 and 107 nm average diameter are synthesized by cathodic contact glow discharge electrolysis at 30, 36 and 42 VDC respectively, in 2 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M ethanol + 2.5 mg ml(-1) of PVP, and are investigated for electrochemical energy storage. From the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 1 M KOH, it was found that a maximum specific capacitance of 218 F g(-1) is achieved with the 70 nm NiO nanoparticles at 2.7 A g(-1). Larger nanoparticles of 91 and 107 nm diameter exhibit specific capacitances of 106 and 63 F g(-1), respectively, suggesting a size-dependent capacitive performance enhanced with decreasing particles size.

AB  - We propose the optimal composition of a polyligand ammonium-chloride-fluoride electrolyte and a mode of electrolysis for the deposition of functional coatings formed by tin-nickel alloys. The tin-nickel alloy with a tin content of 65 wt.% and a nickel content of 35 wt.% proves to be the most promising for microelectronics in the case of its application instead of gold coatings. It is shown that the obtained coatings are suitable for soldering with the use of low-temperature solders and acid-free fluxes and for the ultrasonic spot welding. The electrolytic deposits of tin-nickel alloys are investigated as the anodes of lithium-ion batteries by the potentiodynamic and galvanostatic cycling methods. It is shown that the deposits obtained from an alkaline tartrate-trilonate electrolyte are characterized in the first cycles by a high specific capacity of up to 700 mA. h/g. In the course of cycling, this parameter decreases to 500 mA. h/g. The obtained tin-nickel alloys guarantee high densities of charge-discharge currents without mechanical fracture.

AB  - As the advanced oxidation process of ultraviolet photolysis of chlorine (UV/chlorine) is more effective under an acidic condition than under a basic one, it requires reagent addition to keep the solution pH acidic and to supply free chlorine. In this study, a two-compartment electrochemical flow cell with an anion exchange membrane as a diaphragm was introduced into a UV/chlorine reactor for realizing a reagent-free operation using anodically produced protons and free chlorine. As a result, wastewater in the anodic compartment was successfully acidified by the protons generated through the water discharge at the anode, by the hydrolysis of electrochemically generated chlorine, and by the inhibition of the hydroxide ion supply from the cathodic compartment by the diaphragm. Furthermore, the electrochemical chlorine production was enhanced by increasing the chloride ion concentration in the anodic compartment through the electrodialysis effect. As the acidic effluent from the reactor was finally neutralized by hydroxide ions generated by the water discharge at the cathode, it was demonstrated that the proposed UV/electro-chlorine advanced oxidation process could work well without reagent addition. The electrical energy per order (EEO) of the process was estimated to be 15.7 kWh/(m(3) order), which was comparable to that of the conventional advanced oxidation processes.

AB  - Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super-fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim-catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3-minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25-hour discharging phase. In the power-to-formate-to-bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164 hours under Gas Stand-By model, by storing N-2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand-by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.

AB  - Alloying alkaline metals (AMs) and/or alkaline-earth metals (AEMs) with lead (Pb) is an effective way to increase the mechanical strength of Pb alloys that are commonly employed as grids of lead-acid batteries (LABs). However, current methods for making AM/AEM-Pb alloys by physically mixing pure AM/AEM and Pb face challenges such as instantaneous thermal runaway from exothermic alloy reactions and oxidation of AM/AEM. Herein, sodium-lead (Na-Pb) alloy is directly prepared by molten salt electrolysis without generating Cl2 gas using a molten NaCl-Na2CO3 electrolyte with a current efficiency of above 80 pct at 200 mA<middle dot>cm-2, because the discharge of CO32- is significantly more favorable than that of Cl- at the graphite anode. Furthermore, the reduction of Na+ on the liquid Pb electrode happens at a potential more positive than the reduction of pure Na. The diffusion coefficient of Na in liquid Pb is measured as 3.22 x 10-4 cm2 s-1 at 750 degrees C by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), and the simulated electrolysis current density is 200 mA cm-2. Moreover, the prepared Pb-Ca-Na-Al using the electrolytic Na-Pb alloys achieves a significant mechanical strength improvement (27 pct increase of the hardness, 60 pct increase of the creep resistance). Overall, molten salt electrolysis offers a clean and efficient method for preparing various Pb alloys for next-generation LABs and other applications.

AB  - (CoFe)(S-2)(2) nanoflakes (S-Co5Fe5) with graphene-like edges have been successfully developed by a facile combination of dealloying and sulfurization. Benefiting from the quantities of well-exposed edges and synergistic functionality, the atomic-level bimetallic S-Co5Fe5 exhibits multifunctional electro-catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The S-Co5Fe5 catalyst as both the anode and cathode (S-Co5Fe5 broken vertical bar broken vertical bar S-Co5Fe5) needs only 1.35 V for overall water splitting in 0.1 M KOH and a cell voltage of 1.62 V can drive an electrolyzer current of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, S-Co5Fe5 in a Zn-air battery (ZnAB) as the cathode (Zn plate broken vertical bar broken vertical bar S-Co5Fe5) possesses a high open-circuit voltage of 1.46 V, a high power density of 179 mW cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability at 10 mA cm(-2). Two ZnABs (Zn plate broken vertical bar broken vertical bar S-Co5Fe5) connected in series can not only power up a light-emitting diode (LED, similar to 2.0 V), but also easily afford an overall water splitting electrolyzer.

AB  - Simplifying the design of high-performance electrodes via efficient catalyst design is critical for alkaline water electrolysis and supercapacitor applications. Towards that end, we have developed the environmentally benign synthesis of ultrathin nanosheets of NiFe-layered double hydroxides (LDH) with inbuilt oxygen vacancies (VO) in this report. These NiFe-layered double hydroxide (GNiFe-LDH-VO) materials require low overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta 50 = 200 and eta 100 = 220 mV) with a small Tafel slope of 52.21 mV dec- 1. The ex-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations suggest that oxygen vacancies configure to a more active state, resulting in the low binding energy of oxo intermediates, and thus much lower overpotential. Besides, it could operate stably for 100 h at current densities of 100 mA cm- 2 for OER. It is significant that oxygen vacancies in GNiFe-LDH-VO aid in lowering the main obstacle of multistep OER, which will provide recommendations for the development of high-efficiency catalysts through in situ activation. In addition, GNiFe-LDH-VO exhibits a high areal capacitance of 1.6024 F cm- 2 at a current density of 1 mA cm- 2, with a capacitance retention ratio of 96.1% after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles when they are used as supercapacitor electrodes.

The gluconic acid (reaction product of glucose) fuel cell showed the power density 15 mW cm(-2) being a half of the glucose, and 10e(-) transfer. These results indicated the multi-electron cascade oxidation of glucose via gluconic acid. The energy density of glucose was 803 Wh kg(-1), corresponding to 18% of the theoretical 24e(-) oxidation.

TI  - Design of pulsed power supply for repetitive pulsed high magnetic field for water electrolysis
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA  - English
AB  - A system based on a novel scheme for generating the repetitive pulsed high magnetic field (RPHMF) is developed and applied to enhance the performance of the NdFeB electrocatalyst in alkaline water electrolysis for the first time. In this system, the scheme for generating continuously high-frequency pulses depends on the cooperation of multiple power modules with a new structure. Multiple power modules are connected in parallel to energize the pulsed magnet, and each module is composed of two capacitor banks and a pulse transformer, which is used to realize the conversion of the energy between the two capacitor banks. As the residual energy in one capacitor is transferred to another, the energy required to be replenished for the next pulse reduces substantially. Then, the high repetition rate of the RPHMF can be achieved by discharging the capacitor banks of each module in sequence. The scheme has been validated by the experiment of a 2.4 T/12 Hz prototype with only one power module. Simulation shows that the frequency of the RPHMF can be improved to 12*N Hz with N power modules, and a higher repetition rate of the RPHMF may bring new opportunities to the water electrolysis.

AB  - The electrochemical behavior of lanthanide elements deposited on liquid zinc cathodes was studied using cydic voltammetry (CV) and open circuit chronopotentiometry (OCP). We observed a "bimodal effect" in the equilibrium deposition potentials of zinc with lanthanides. A mathematic equation is derived to illustrate the relationship between the equilibrium potential of the intermetallic compounds formed by lanthanide elements and zinc and their atomic radius. This equation is not only applicable to lanthanide elements but also hold for other elements such as alkali metal lithium, alkaline earth metal magnesium, calcium and transition metal niobium. which have crucial theoretical significance for the electrolysis of intermetallic compounds, the separation, and extraction of metals.

AB  - Thanks to their high power density and degree of reversibility, supercapacitors are electrochemical devices that narrow the gap between secondary batteries and traditional dielectric capacitors in the traditional Ragone plot. However, their use is still hindered by their capability to achieve higher energy density. In this work, we present a one-pot synthesis procedure of composite graphitic carbon flake-supported NiO for electrochemical energy storage application. We used cathodic contact glow discharge electrolysis by applying 120Vdc terminal voltage between a thin Pt wire, slightly submerged in an aqueous solution of NiSO4(H2O)(6)+Na2SO4, and a large surface area carbon graphite anode. Strong active species generated within the micro-plasma volume locally reduce the nickel precursors to form NiO materials, while at the anodically polarized graphite rod, the forces holding the graphene layers together are weakened by ion/solvent intercalation producing micrometer-sized graphitic carbon flakes. The morphological characterization is carried out by electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, constant-current charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 5moll(-1) KOH solution are carried out to evaluate the electrochemical energy storage performance of the material. We show that carbon flake-supported NiO exhibits the dual combination of electric double-layer capacitance with faradic behavior, giving 495Fg(-1) specific capacitance at 2Ag(-1) current density.

AB  - The present study reports the formation of alumina-based inorganic layer via soft plasma discharges for optimizing chemical stability and catalytic activity together. Alkaline silicate electrolyte with complexing agent is formulated to 'soften' the destructive nature of plasma discharges in water. The presence of complexing agent having large denticity activates the swarms of soft plasma events, resulting in a less porous architecture than that with simple structure due to a homogenization of electrical field. Accordingly, such inorganic layer comprises stable aluminosilicate since chemical transformations are facilitated to a greater extent by soft plasma discharges. The conformal inorganic layer in the present work demonstrates protective and catalytic features together on account of a synergy between compact microstructure and dynamic surface topography caused by residual tracks of plasma discharges. The reformation of electrical double layer after disruptive events, which underlines the formation of soft plasma discharges, is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculation and impedance analysis.

AB  - Unlike carbon materials such as graphene, reduced graphite/graphene oxide, activated carbon, etc., graphite oxide (GO) is not considered to be a potent active material for energy storage applications. This study proposes a sustainable approach for developing high energy and power density supercapacitors using graphite oxide (GO) active material, viz., binder free coating and water in salt (WIS) electrolyte. The use of 17 m NaClO4 WIS electrolyte ensures an electrochemical stability window of 2.5 V, which surpasses the thermodynamic limit of water electrolysis. In three electrode configuration, the binder free Ni@GO electrode achieved an energy density of 31.2 Wh/kg and a power density of 625 W/kg, with excellent cycle stability of 133.3 % after 1000 chargedischarge cycles. Energy and power densities of Ni@GO electrodes in aqueous electrolytes viz., 6 M KOH (1.5 Wh/kg and 137 W/kg) and 1 M Na2SO4 (12.6 Wh/kg and 349 W/kg) were significantly lower than those in WIS electrolytes. The GO/17 m NaClO4 WIS symmetric supercapacitor achieved energy and power density values of 24 Wh/kg and 1250 W/kg at 0.5 A/g, with 100 % retention of cycle stability after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The energy density values achieved through this strategy of binder-free GO/WIS based supercapacitors are consistent with the range reported for other carbon materials, including activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide. This suggests that the approach has significant potential for developing highenergy-density supercapacitors using GO, which could have practical applications in a variety of fields.

AB  - The connection between the active components and supports in a catalyst is important for the high activity and long-term stability during catalysis. Here, Co3O4 nanoparticles embedded in F, N-doped graphene (Co3O4/F, N-doped G) are synthesized by silicon-hydrogen bond reduction. F and N atoms doped graphene interacts with Co3O4 nanoparticles to optimize oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. The optimal Co3O4/F, N-doped G-2 catalyst with Co loading of 3.38 wt% shows a half-wave potential of 0.852 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, Co3O4/F, N-doped G-2 catalyst outputs an extremely high open circuit voltage of 1.47 V and an excellent power density of 280 mW cm(-2) at current density of 450 mA cm(-2) when applied to the primary Zn-air batteries. Due to the synergetic effects from Co3O4 and supports (F, N-doped G), Co3O4/F, N-doped G-2 catalyst also shows excellent stability and anti-toxicity, and has good practical application prospects.

AB  - A nickel-doped cobalt oxide spinel structure is a promising non-precious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction in rechargeable metal-air batteries and water electrolyzers operating with alkaline electrolytes. One dimensional NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanostructures were prepared by using a simple electrospinning technique with two different metal precursors (metal nitrate/PAN and metal acetylacetonate/PAN). The effect of precursor concentration on the morphologies was investigated. Single-phase, NCO with an average diameter of 100 nm, porous interconnected fibrous morphology was revealed by FESEM and FETEM analysis. The hierarchical nanostructured 1D-spinel NiCo2O4 materials showed a remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and evolution in an aqueous alkaline medium. The extraordinary bi-functional catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER was observed by the low over potential (0.84 V), which is better than that of noble metal catalysts [Pt/C (1.16 V), Ru/C (1.01 V) and Ir/C (0.92 V)], making them promising cathode materials for metal-air batteries. Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc-air battery with NCO-A(1) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst displays high activity and stability during battery discharge, charge, and cycling processes.

AB  - Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for Zn-air batteries, while also serves as a core electrochemical process in oxygen depolarized cathodes (ODCs) for chlor-alkali electrolysis. The lack of cost-effective, highly active ORR electrocatalysts with superior kinetics hinders progress in this field. Herein, we report the Fe/Ni dual single-atomic sites anchored by commercial carbon black (Fe/Ni-N/CB) using rigid ligand confined and high-temperature shock (HTS) strategy in less than 0.5 s. Theoretical calculation reveals that single-atomic Fe is the real active site. Single-atomic Fe and Ni species in Fe/Ni-N/CB synergistically accelerate the kinetics of ORR by reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. A large half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.907 V is achieved in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. The assembled aqueous Zn-air battery (A-ZAB) with Fe/Ni-N/CB cathode presents remarkable charge-discharge cycling stability for over 650 h without voltage gap degradation. The quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery (QSS-ZAB) exhibits excellent reversibility over a 150-h operation at 0.5 mA center dot cm(-2) with negligible energy conversion efficiency recession. Impressively, Fe/Ni-N/CB||RuO2 chlor-alkali flow cell exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.60 V at a large current density of 300 mA center dot cm(-2) at 80 degrees C, and demonstrates exceptional durability with 7% current density decay over 150 h of continuous operation at 100 mA center dot cm(-2). Fe/Ni-N/CB||RuO2 achieves near-ideal caustic current efficiency (similar to 97.2%) at the current density of 300 mA center dot cm(-2). This work provides a rapid and economical synthesis technique for the synthesis of catalysts at the atomic scale while demonstrating significant potential for application in energy-saving chlor-alkali electrolyzer.

AB  - Co-Mo-O (Co1.2MoO4.2 center dot 1.3H(2)O)/Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays were in-situ grown directly on Ni foam (NF) by a facile two-step hydrothermal reaction, in which the untrathin Co-Mo-O nanosheets are connected to each other into a three-dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical architecture with Ni3S2 entrapped on the underneath Ni support. The resulting Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in KOH solution, which yields a 50 mA cm(-2) of OER current density at an overpotential of 0.29 V, outperforming the state-of-the-art noble RuO2 (eta 50 = 0.42 V), Co-Mo-O/NF (eta 50 = 0.33 V) and Ni3S2/NF (eta 50 = 0.31 V). And it demonstrates a high specific capacity of 340 mAh g(-1) at 2 mA cm(-2) with good capability (82.1% of the retention at 32 mA cm(-2)) in basic solution when used as supercapacitor electrode, which is superior to those of Co-Mo-O/NF (183 mAh g(-1)) and Ni3S2/NF (70 mAh g(-1)). The outstanding electrochemical performance of Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF is associated with the synergistic effect of the individual components as well as the nanosheets directly grown on Ni conducting support with more active sites exposed. Furthermore, Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF displays good durability in 12 h-electrolysis experiment for OER and 10000 charge-discharge cycles. It is expected to benefit from Ni3S2 entrapped by the protective layer of 3D porous Co-Mo-O nanosheet arrays, which not only can provide channel for electrolyte ion to pass through, but also improve the stability of Ni3S2. In addition, the fabricated Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/NF//Activated carbon (AC) asymmetrical supercapacitor shows an ultra-high energy density of 57.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1.1 kW kg(-1).

AB  - Double perovskite oxides are key players as oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction catalysts in alkaline media due to their tailorable electronic structures by doping. In this study, we synthesized B-site doped NdBaCoaFe2-aO5+delta (a=1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8) electrocatalysts, systematically probed their bifunctionality and assessed their performance in zinc-air batteries as air cathodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals a correlation between iron reduction and increased oxygen vacancy content, influencing electrocatalyst bifunctionality by lowering the work function. The electrocatalyst with highest cobalt content, NdBaCo1.8Fe0.2O5+delta exhibited a bifunctionality value of 0.95 V, outperforming other synthesized electrocatalysts. Remarkably, NdBaCo1.8Fe0.2O5+delta, demonstrated facilitated charge transfer rate in oxygen evolution reaction with four-electron oxygen reduction reaction process. As an air cathode in a zinc-air battery, NdBaCo1.8Fe0.2O5+delta demonstrated superior performance characteristics, including maximum capacity of 428.27 mA h at 10 mA cm-2 discharge current density, highest peak power density of 64 mW cm-2, with an enhanced durability and stability. It exhibits lowest voltage gap change between charge and discharge even after 350 hours of cyclic operation with a rate capability of 87.14 %.

AB  - A crucial challenge in hydrogen production through electrolysis is developing inexpensive, earth-abundant, and highly efficient Pt-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Molybdenum carbide is ideal for this application because of its special electrical structure, low cost, and advantageous characteristics. Herein, the long-lived electrocatalysts for HER have been synthesized via the direct rent (DC) arc discharge plasma method under ambient air conditions, and the relationship between properties of materials and catalytic characteristics has been established. The samples differed in the ratio of molybdenum, graphite, and melamine. The sample with the highest proportion of melamine in the initial mixture has Mo2C-MoO2 heterointerfaces, which demonstrates the highest and most stable electrocatalytic activity with the overpotential of 148 mV at 10 mA cm-2 2 and Tafel slope of 63 mV dec-1- 1 in alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, the electrodes demonstrated long-lived electrochemical durability for two weeks and investigated the features of forming a stable system for HER.

AB  - Electrocatalyst design is an important approach to prompt the commercialization of water electrolysis technologies. In this work, a ruthenium doped MoS2/AB heterostructure is synthesized as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through hydrothermal and annealing processes. The physical-chemical characterization studies show that the MoS2/AB heterostructure and the incorporation of Ru effectively induce a phase transition from 2H to 1T-MoS2. The as-prepared Ru-MoS2/AB exhibits an excellent HER performance with a very low overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, remarkably higher than those of Pt/C (overpotential of 28 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 41 mV dec(-1)). Density functional theory calculations suggest that the H absorption on Ru bonding to S exhibits a rather low binding energy (-0.22 eV), indicating the optimum active sites of Ru near S for HER. Significantly, the Ru-MoS2/AB also demonstrates high stability under long-term discharge and elevated temperature conditions. These results suggest that the as-prepared Ru-MoS2/AB can be a promising alternative to Pt/C for water electrolysis, due to its high HER activity, easy synthesis, and good stability.

AB  - Exploring advanced electrolysis techniques for attaining scene-adaptive and on-site green H2 production is an imperative matter of utmost practical significance but grand challenge remains. Herein, drawn inspiration from a spontaneous hydrazine-H2O galvanic cell configured on a low-valence Ru single atoms-loaded Mo2C electrode (RuSA/v-Mo2C), an alternative H2 energy solution utilizing self-powered electrochemical hydrazine splitting (N2H4 -> 2H2 + N2) instead of the stereotyped electricity-consumed water splitting for green H2 production is proposed. This solution highlights a pH-decoupled hydrazine-H2O primary battery with notable open-circuit voltage of 1.37 V and energy density up to 358 Wh gN2H4-1, which powerfully propels an alkaline hydrazine splitting cell, leading to bilateral H2 harvest with a remarkable rate of 18 mol h-1 m-2, i.e., 403.2 L h-1 m-2, setting a new record for the self-sustaining electricity-powered H2 production systems. The success of RuSA/v-Mo2C for this solution is further decoded by tandem theoretical and in situ spectroscopic studies, cross-verifying a Ru-Mo dual-site synergy in streamlining the overall energy barriers, thereby enhancing the kinetics of electrode reactions. This pioneering work, showcasing electrochemical H2 production free from both external energy and feedstock inputs, opens up a new horizon on way of the ultimate H2 energy solution.

AB  - Electrochemical technology is a promising technique for separating ammonia from mature landfill leachate. However, the accompanying migration and transformation of coexisting pollutants and strategies for further high-value resourceful utilization of ammonia have rarely received attention. In this study, an electrochemical separation-Rhodopseudomonas palustris electrolysis cell coupled system was initially constructed for efficient separation and conversion of nitrogen in mature landfill leachate to microbial protein with synchronously tracking the transport and conversion of coexisting heavy metals accompanying the process. The results revealed that ammonia concentration in the cathode increased from 40.3 to 49.8% with increasing the current density from 20 to 40 mA/cm(2), with less than 3% of ammonia transformation to NO2--N and NO3--N. During ammonia separation, approximately 95% of HM-DOMs (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were released into the anolyte due to humus degradation and further diffused to the cathode. A significant correlation was observed between the releases of HM-DOMs. Cu-DOMs accounted for 70.2% of the total Cu content, which was the highest proportion among the heavy metals (HMs). Among the HMs in anolyte, 57.4% of Pb, 52.5% of Ni, and 50.6% of Zn diffused to the cathode, and most of the HMs were removed in the form of hydroxide precipitations due to heavy alkaline catholyte. Compared with the open-circuit condition, the utilization efficiency of NH4+-N in the R. palustris electrolysis cell increased by 445.1% with 47% and 50% increases in final NH4+-N conversion rate and R. palustris biomass, respectively, due to bio-electrochemical enhanced phototrophic metabolism and acid generation for buffering the strong alkalinity of the electrolyte to maintain suitable growth conditions for R. palustris.

AB  - This study investigates the electro-oxidation of ethanol in seawater-like electrolytes with adjusted pH, exploring its potential for CO2 mitigation strategies. Using a polycrystalline platinum bead as a model catalyst in a conventional three-electrode cell, we demonstrate that pH adjustment significantly influences electrochemical performance, with higher oxidation current densities observed at more alkaline pH values. At pH 12, usable current densities for ethanol oxidation were achieved, attributed to the decreased surface coverage of Cl- ions and increased ethoxy ion concentrations, consistent with observations from similar systems in the literature. However, mass transport limitations emerged at higher potential scan rates, evident from the inversion in peak current densities between pH 13 and pH 14 compared to lower scan rates. Additionally, voltammetric profiles indicated a preference for certain platinum crystallographic faces due to variations in chloride and sulfate binding strength. Notably, potential oscillations, not previously reported under such elevated Cl- concentrations, further support these findings. Tafel analysis in the high potential region (> 1.2 V) revealed that the platinum oxide surface does not become more sensitive to ethanol oxidation with increasing pH. These insights provide an initial understanding of the main opportunities and challenges in studying and applying such systems.

AB  - The article provides a brief overview of the results concerning synthesis of inorganic nanocrystals including such compounds as Ag, Au, NiO1+x center dot nH(2)O, CoAl and ZnCo layered double hydroxides (LDH) by Successive Ionic Layer Deposition (SILD) method in aqueous solutions. It is shown that by specifying the synthesis conditions, for example, the number of SILD cycles, it is possible to change the size of nanocrystals, and for 2D crystals - their orientation with respect to the substrate. Along with this, in the article for the first time a novel SILD route of Co(II)Co(III) LDH synthesis is presented. It was stated that the nanolayers of this compound consist of randomly oriented 2D nanocrystals aggregates with hexagonal hydrotalcite-like crystal structure, each of which has a thickness of less than 3 nm. The method is based on the sequential processing of the substrate in aqueous solutions of CoCl2 and NaBH4 salts of certain concentrations and intermediate washing excess of these reagents with distilled water. The obtained nanolayers were characterized via SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR and XPS methods. Models of chemical processes occurring on the surface during the synthesis were suggested on the basis of the obtained experimental results. The samples were acquired on the nickel foam (NF) surface and were studied as electrodes for pseudocapacitors and as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The electrodes of the pseudocapacitor showed high specific capacitance (2260 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g), as well as good cyclic stability (after 500 charge-discharge cycles, the capacitance drop do not exceed 2%). In addition, the obtained material showed a high electrocatalytic activity for OER in alkaline medium, characterized at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) by a relatively low overpotential of 285 mV and Tafel slope of 95 mV/dec (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrazine-assisted hybrid alkaline seawater electrolysis offers a dual-functional platform for environmentally benign remediation of toxic hydrazine and energy-autonomous hydrogen generation. Addressing the critical need for simplified system integration, a single-metal bifunctional catalyst is developed by modulating electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) to construct semi-crystalline Ru domains with metastable crystalline-amorphous interfaces. The optimized catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 21.5 mV (hydrogen evolution) and 254 mV (hydrazine oxidation) at 10 mA cm(-)2, alongside spontaneous hydrazine decomposition at open-circuit potential. This synergy enables near-zero energy input for electrolysis, evidenced by a steep polarization slope (1.235 A cm(-)2 V--(1)), which surpasses conventional hybrid systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amorphous Ru sites near the interface induce charge redistribution, which partially optimizes the free energy changes associated with adsorption *H and the dehydrogenation process from *N2H4 to *N2H3. This is accompanied by a transformation of the rate-determining step into the *N2H -> *N-2 pathway, thereby advancing the kinetics of the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrazine oxidation reaction (HER/HzOR) reactions. The work redefines catalyst design paradigms by leveraging interfacial metastability, bridging pollutant elimination with high-efficiency hydrogen economies.

AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) Pd-based materials have been extensively researched as a cathode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to its distinctive physicochemical characteristics. In this paper, we report the controllable construction of porous wrinkled PdZn bimetallene (PdZn BMene) with the lattice distortions and grain boundaries via a one-step hydrothermal approach. Benefiting from the curved 2D metallene morphology, more sufficient and exposed active sites, and synergistic effect of alloy components, the resultant PdZn BMene exhibits outstanding ORR performance in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, with the mass activity of 1.11 mA & mu;gPd � 1, which is 1.6, 6.4, and 21.6 times higher than those of Pd metallene (0.43 mA & mu;gPd � 1), commercial Pt/C (0.15 mA & mu;gPd � 1), and Pd/ C (0.049 mA & mu;gPd � 1), respectively. Moreover, PdZn BMene also possesses commendable durability, with only 7.2% activity loss after 30,000 potential cycles and a 5.3% attenuation of current density after 10-h durability test. Meanwhile, the assembled zinc-air battery with PdZn BMene as cathode catalyst possess an open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V and a maximum power density of 108.7 mW cm-2 along with benign durability. The present study highlights the advances of 2D Pd-based alloy bimetallene for realizing high-performance against the ORR application.

AB  - In pursuit of advanced nanocatalysts with multifunctionality, cost-effectiveness and durability for water splitting and zinc-air batteries, we unveil a novel strategy by combination of electrochemically etched Nb4C3Tx-MXene nanosheets with Fe-N-C single-atom catalyst. The resultant Fe-N-C/Nb4C3Tx demonstrates exceptional electro-catalytic performances for the ORR (E1/2 = 0.911 V), OER (eta 10 = 1.52 V), and HER (eta 10 = 91 mV) in the alkaline media. Besides, the catalyst shows excellent application in water splitting electrolyzer, only requiring 1.58 V for a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Further, the Fe-N-C/Nb4C3Tx assembled battery displays an open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, a higher peak power density (136 mW cm-2), a narrower polarization gap (0.85 V), and remarkable stability (660 cycles over 220 h), surpassing the Pt/C + RuO2 based counterpart. Our study integrates DFT calculations to guide the catalyst design, laying the foundation for development of reliable and effective tri-functional catalysts in advanced energy-related systems.

AB  - Electrochemical energy storage and conversion mechanisms are highly viable routes in the current scenario, and hence supercapacitor and electrolysis of water splitting have gained significant attention in recent times. Thus, transition metal nickel cobalt oxides are widely inspected as promising electrode materials for electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. However, the pure NiCo2O4 was highly hindered by its widespread uses due to low electronic conductivity and deficient active edges. This study is aimed to fabricate the NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 composite using a solvothermal process with different ratios of solvents. The inherent NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 composite holds plentiful active edges and improved electrical conductivity than the pure. Interestingly, the electrocatalytic results revealed that the NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 (NC) composite prepared by a solvent ratio of (double distilled water (DDW) to N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF)) 2:1 (NC1) displayed the small overpotentials of 144 and 142 mV to realize 10 mA cm(-2) with the robust durability during a 24 hours hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) test in the acid and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Moreover, the designed NC1 composite as a supercapacitor electrode exhibited considerable capacitance of 638 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). In comparison, the analog DDW to DMF ratio 1:1 (NC2) and 1:2 (NC3) structures showed 514 F g(-1) and 415 F g(-1), respectively. Further, a dual-electrode device was fabricated using the NC1 composite and activated carbon, exhibited an energy density of 28.14 W h kg(-1) at 414.45 W kg(-1) power density with excellent device stability (89.4%) for 10 000 charge/discharge cycles.

AB  - Simultaneous electroexfoliation of graphite on both cathode and anode in molten NaOH-KOH was proposed and found to be a feasible method for the mass production of carbon nanomaterials. During this electrolysis process, alkaline cations and hydroxide ions were intercalated into the bulk graphite and then discharged to generate alkaline metals and hydrogen at the cathode, and oxygen at the anode. The simultaneous intercalation on both electrodes and the escape of gas enhanced the exfoliation efficiency, leading to a high production rate of nanostructured carbon exceeding 26.9 g h(-1). The four to seven layers of graphene nanosheets with negligible defect (I-D/I-G = 0.079) and low oxidation degree (C/O ratio = 20.32) were obtained through cathodic exfoliation, while the corresponding anodic exfoliation products featured more oxygen-containing functional groups (7.59%). This introduced method was beneficial for the mass production of carbon materials in a highly efficient way.

Compared with the liquefaction of sawdust under acidic conditions, the discharge changed from corona to spark discharge, the liquefaction time was a little longer (8 min), and the pondus Hydrogenii (pH) of the bio-oil was 7.54 under sodium hydroxide catalyst. We identified the optimal parameters for sawdust liquefaction by sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate using a single factor method and found that the optimal parameters for sodium hydroxide and carbonate were quite different, apparently because they have different liquefaction mechanisms. When the water content increased, the liquefaction rate remained constant, so the water content prolonged the treatment time but did not affect the liquefaction rate or product quality. To analyze the universality of liquefied cellulose biomass under alkaline conditions, corn cob, rice straw, and cotton were liquefied separately. We found that the liquefaction time increased significantly with an increase in cellulose content. Notably, plasma electrolytic liquefaction efficiently heated the solution and effectively catalyzed the liquefaction of biomass with high energy efficiency, making this a promising biomass conversion technology.

AB  - The commercialization of mass hydrogen production via water electrolysis is presently limited by low operational current densities. The optimal performance of electrolysis cells is significantly influenced by the substantial formation and residence of bubbles at high current densities. Thus, it is crucial to design electrodes with the ability for rapid bubble discharge to ensure appropriate bubble management. However, the quantitative volumetric measurements required to determine the bubble discharge ability of an electrode are not yet sufficiently accurate. This paper describes a quantitative volumetric method that combines a stereoscopic shadowgraph imaging system with particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) to measure the three-dimensional position, size, and velocity of micrometer-sized bubbles. The proposed method successfully captures hydrogen bubbles larger than 30 mu m bubbles in an alkaline water electrolyzer. Considering the different luminance patterns of small bubbles (r <= 4 pixels) and large bubbles (r > 4 pixels) in the current imaging system, a bubble-size adaptive detection algorithm is established based on the cascade correlation method to obtain the two-dimensional centroid coordinates and radius of the observed bubbles. The bubble size information is also introduced into a two-view PTV algorithm for retrieving the Lagrangian trajectory of each bubble. Both the bubble detection and PTV algorithms are validated using synthetic datasets. Once the bubble trajectories are resolved successfully, the three-dimensional bubble velocity is obtained, and the actual bubble sizes are further corrected using the depth information. Analysis of the trajectory and velocity components indicates the existence of lateral bubble motion, reflecting interactions among bubbles. The rise velocity is positively correlated with the bubble radius in two regions, respectively, and the deviation from the theoretical value reveals the influence of non-buoyancy factors. The proposed technique provides effective diagnostics of the three-dimensional dynamic characteristics of micrometer-sized bubbles and can be used to evaluate and design bubble management systems for various electrochemical energy conversion devices.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs) were investigated as a promising technology to manage waste activated sludge (WAS) reduction and bio-methane generation. The effect of WAS concentration on the MECs performance was discussed. At the optimal concentration of 15 g COD/L, maximum methane yield of MECs fed with alkaline pretreated WAS (A-WAS) were achieved with the value of 77.13 +/- 2.52 L CH4/kg-COD on Day 3, which had been improved by 1.5-fold compared with MECs fed with raw WAS (R-WAS), while that was negligible in open circuit controls. Efficient sludge reduction was also obtained in terms of TCOD, total protein, TSS and VSS removal. Pyrosequencing revealed the dominance of exoelectrogen Geobacter and hydrogen-producing bacteria Petrimonas in MECs fed with WAS. Methanocorpusculum with the capacity of methane generation using CO2 and H-2 also showed overwhelming dominance (96.01%). The large proportions of Petrimonas and Methanocorpusculum indicated the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in our methane-producing MECs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As is obvious from previous work on semiconductor photoelectrochemistry, single junction semiconductors do not provide either the required maximum photovoltage or a high photocurrent for solar water splitting, which is required for efficient stand-alone devices. From these experiences we conclude, that multijunction devices must be developed for bias-free water splitting. In this article we present our design considerations needed for the development of efficient photoelectro- synthetic cells, which have guided us during the DFG priority program 1613. At first, we discuss the fundamental requirements, which must be fulfilled to lead to effective solar water splitting devices. Buried junction and photoelectrochemical arrangements are compared. It will become clear, that the photovoltaic (PV) and electrochemical (EC) components can be optimized separately, but that maximized conversion efficiencies need photovoltages produced in the photovoltaic part of the device, which are adapted to the electrochemical performance of the electrolyzer components without energetic losses in their coupling across the involved interfaces. Therefore, in part 2 we will present the needs to develop appropriate interface engineering layers for proper chemical and electronic surface passivation. In addition, highly efficient electrocatalysts, either for the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction (HER, OER), must be adjusted in their energetic coupling to the semiconductor band edges and to the redox potentials in the electrolyte with minimized losses in the chemical potentials. The third part of our paper describes at first the demands and achievements on developing multijunction thin-film silicon solar cells. With different arrangements of silicon stacks a wide range of photovoltages and photocurrents can be provided. These solar cells are applied as photocathodes in integrated directly coupled PV-EC devices. For this purpose thin Pt and Ni catalyst layers are used on top of the solar cells for the HER and a wire connected RuO2 counter electrode is used for the OER. Electrochemical stability has been successfully tested for up to 10,000 s in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, we will illustrate our experimental results on interface engineering strategies using TiO2 as buffer layer and Pt nanostructures as HER catalyst. Based on the obtained results the observed improvements, but also the still given limitations, can be related to clearly identified non-idealities in surface engineering either related to recombination losses at the semiconductor surface reducing photocurrents or due to not properly-aligned energy states leading to potential losses across the interfaces.

AB  - One key step for advancing the widespread practical application of rechargeable metal-air batteries and water electrolysis fundamentally relies on the development of cost-effective multifunctional electrocatalysts toward oxygen and hydrogen-involving reactions. The present work initiates a tofu-derived one-pot strategy for green, facile, and mass production of highly active and stable catalyst toward oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions, through the preparation of Fe/Co cross-linked tofu gel and the subsequent pyrolysis. Despite the free use of additional N/P precursors or pore-forming agents, the as-prepared materials comprise highly dispersive FeCo-rich phosphides nanoparticles and porous N,P co-doped carbon network inherited from the tofu skeleton. The resultant catalysts exhibit remarkably enhanced trifunctional activities as compared to the Fe2P and Co2P counterparts, along with better long-term stabilities than the benchmark RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Accordingly, the as-assembled Zn-air battery delivers a large power density (174 mW cm-2) with excellent cycle stability (the gap of charge/discharge voltage@10 mA cm-2 increases by 0.01 V after 720 h of operation, vs. 0.16 V of Pt/C-RuO2 based battery after 378 h). Furthermore, the as-constructed alkaline electrolyzer just requires a small voltage of 1.55 V@10 mA cm-2, which outperforms nearly all of those of biomass-derived electrocatalysts ever reported, and that of noble metal catalysts-based electrolyzers (1.72 V@10 mA cm-2 for Pt/C-RuO2), underscoring their bright future toward commercial applications in green energy conversion devices.

AB  - Brick-shaped zinc tungstate nanoparticles have been synthesized by ecofriendly solvent-free process using molten salts. Zinc tungstate nanobricks (ZnWO4 Nbs) were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), FTIR, Raman, energy dispersive and electron microscopic studies. ZnWO4 Nbs are used as the multifunctional electrode materials to oxygen generation reactions (OGR), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and supercapacitors (SCs) as well as photo-catalysts in the waste-water treatment by the degradation of organic dyes. Low overpotential (AE (10) = 0.475 V), low tafel slope (140 mV/dec), high current density (70 mA/cm(2)) and good stability of the electrodes are the key results of the present studies for water electrolysis (OGR/ORR). ZnWO4 Nbs have also shown great interest in supercapacitors with efficient charge-discharge activities in 1 M KOH. The specific capacitance and energy density of ZnWO4 Nbs were found to be 250 F/g and 80 Wh/kg, respectively, at 5 mV/s, these values are relatively higher than that of previously reported specific capacitance and energy density value of metal tungstate nanoparticles. ZnWO4 Nbs as the photo-catalysts work very significantly for photocatalytic degradation of aqueous MB dye solution (85 % in 3 h) in neutral medium.<UnorderedList

AB  - The rational design of efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with maximized atom utilization is essential for advancing the oxygen depolarized cathode technology. Here, we report atomically dispersed Fe, P heteronuclear catalytic pairs on hierarchical porous carbon, in which the hydrogen bond between Fe, P catalytic pairs and ORR intermediates significantly enhances the adsorption/desorption kinetics and lowers the rate-determining step barrier of OH* desorption. Thus, Fe,P/HPC delivers an alkaline ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.92 V and retains similar to 90% of the initial activity even after 150 h operation. In addition, Fe,P/HPC achieves an E 1/2 of 0.74 V in 0.1 M HClO4. The Fe,P/HPC-based aqueous Zn-air battery (A-ZAB) achieves a high power density of 262 mW cm-2 and exhibits enhanced stability, sustaining a minimal voltage gap over 2800 h of constant-current cycling. Moreover, the quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery (QSS-ZAB) delivers a large open-circuit voltage of 1.52 V, while maintaining a cycling stability for over 95 h at 0.5, 1, and 2 mA cm-2, respectively. In the chlor-alkali process, the Fe,P/HPC||RuO2 electrolyzer enables a large current density of 300 mA cm-2 at 1.66 V and maintains stability over 110 h. The present work pioneers the designing and construction of atomic-level heteronuclear catalysts for practical and durable cathode.

AB  - A low energy electrolysis process that directly converts native biomasses to hydrogen at low temperature was reported. Practically, an environmentally-friendly proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC) uses a simple redox ion pair, Fe3+/Fe2+, as the catalyst which functions as an oxidation agent (oxidizing biomass), charge carrier (transferring the charge to anode) and discharge agent (discharge on anode electrode). The electro-catalytic activity of Fe3+/Fe2+ ion was demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and the rate for hydrogen evolution was measured at different current densities. At very low cell potential, smaller than 0.7 V, hydrogen begins to be produced, which is much less than the any noble metal catalysis water splitting hydrogen evolution. The electric energy consumption in our experiments for glucose-Fe ion system is 1.845 kWh Nm(-3) H-2 at 100 mA cm(-2), which can save about 60.74% electric energy of traditional typical alkaline water electrolysis (4.7 kWh Nm(-3) H-2 at U-H2O = 2 V, the current density is 100 mA cm(-2)). Different from reported alcohol electrolysis, the biomass based electrolysis process does not require any noble-metal catalyst on the anode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cheap and advanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are vitally significant but challenging for seawater electrolysis. Herein, a glow discharge N2 plasma is used to etch the [Fe(CN)6]4- group of the NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) framework by highly reactive nitrogen radicals (the catalyst named N2-NiCoFe-PBA). Abundant CN vacancies (VCN) generated by this etching effectively suppress the Fe loss from N2-NiCoFe-PBA, while the lack of VCN results in the Fe leaching from the NiCoFe-PBA precursor during the anodic process. Consequently, N2-NiCoFe-PBA and NiCoFe-PBA are transformed into real active phases of NiCoFeOOH and NiCoOOH during the OER process, respectively. Theoretical calculations display that NiCoFeOOH has superior adsorption capacity toward OH- over Cl- to NiCoOOH, which is beneficial to excellent OER activity and anticorrosion performance in alkaline seawaters. In alkaline simulated and natural seawater, N2-NiCoFe-PBA exhibits much better OER performance with smaller eta 100 (293 and 323 mV) than NiCoFe-PBA (405 and 434 mV). N2-NiCoFe-PBA can run stably over 110 h in an alkaline high-salty electrolyte (1 M KOH + 2.0 M NaCl) at 250 mA cm-2. This study provides a modification method without destroying the structure to develop efficient and stable OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.

AB  - In the course of microbial fuel cell (MFC) operation, the acidification of the anode and the alkalization of the cathode inevitably occur, resulting in reduction of the overall performance. In an attempt to reverse the membrane pH gradient, a tubular air-cathode two-chamber MFC was developed that allowed pH adjustment in both compartments. With an anodic pH of 10.0 and a cathodic pH of 2.0, the tubular MFC provided an open circuit voltage of 1.04 V and a maximum power density of 29.9 W/m(3), which were respectively 1.5 and 3.8 times higher than those obtained in the same MFC working at neutral pH. Particularly, the suppression of methanogenesis at high alkaline anode (pH 10.0) contributed to a significant enhancement in coulombic efficiency. The MFC maintained 74% of its performance after 15 days of operation in continuous-flow mode. The appropriate pH adjustment strategy in both compartments ensures a promising improvement in MFC performance. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) holds promise for the reduction of environmentally taxing CO2 emissions, for the carbon-neutral production of valuable fuels and chemicals, and for storage of excess renewable energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar in chemical products. Durability of cathodes used in high-throughput CO2RR systems is of paramount importance for the commercial readiness of the CO2RR technology. In this study, we investigate the durability of silver-coated gas diffusion electrode cathodes under potential cycling conditions to simulate the impact of repeated cycles of startup and shutdown as might be experienced in connection with a variable renewable power source. We determine that cycling can impact the cathode via two distinct degradation mechanisms: (1) carbonate formation at negative potentials and (2) catalyst layer restructuring and loss in the relatively positive "oxide formation " potential range. We also explore tailored potential cycling as a mechanism for inhibiting carbonate formation by interrupting the high concentration of OH- at the catalyst layer. The findings from this work lend insight into the types of variable potential operating conditions under which CO2RR systems can deliver continuous, robust performance.

AB  - Stable, efficient, and economical bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In this study, a directional electron transfer pathway is exploited in a spatial heterojunction of CoyNix@Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C heterogeneous catalyst for effective bifunctional electrolysis (OER/ORR). Thereinto, the Co/Ni alloy is strongly coupled to the Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C support through Co/Ni & horbar;N bonds. DFT calculations and experimental findings confirm that Co/Ni & horbar;N bonds play a bridging role in the directional electron transfer from Co/Ni alloy to the Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C support, increasing the content of pyridinic nitrogen in the ORR-active support. In addition, the discovered directional electron transfer mechanism enhances both the ORR/OER activity and the durability of the catalyst. The Co0.66Ni0.34@Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C with the optimal Ni/Co ratio exhibits satisfying bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, requiring an ORR half-wave potential of 0.90 V and an OER overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolytes. The assembled rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) incorporating Co0.66Ni0.34@Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C cathode exhibits a charge-discharge voltage gap comparable to the Pt/C||IrO2 assembly and high robustness for over 60 h at 20 mA cm-2.
   The electron transfer ability of bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR is improved by achieving directional electron transfer between Co/Ni alloys and Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C support. The existence of new directional electron transfer pathway activates pyridinic N within the support, an electronic structure of surface metal active sites is modulated. Therefore, the bifunctional catalytic activity and stability of CoyNix@Fe & horbar;N & horbar;C are enhanced. image

AB  - Wastewater containing high contents of salt, organics, acids, or other compounds pollutes the environment. It is necessary and important to treat wastewater and recover reusable materials before the discharge. Diffusion dialysis (DD), electrodialysis (ED) and bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) are combined in three different ways in this study. These methods are compared on their operating time, energy consumption, as well as recovery of sulfuric acid and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ions. Results suggest that DD-ED-BMED is the best combination with the shortest operation time and least energy consumption. The recovery of sulfuric acid reaches 99.6%, while that for TBA(+) is 93.1%. An economical evaluation is discussed. To minimize the total cost of treating 150 L wastewater per hour, the total membrane area of DD process needs to be 179.4 m(2). Total membrane area for ED process is 85.61 m(2). For BMED process, 27.43 m(2) of bipolar membrane and 54.86 m(2) of anion exchange membranes and cation exchange membranes should be used. In this case, the total cost would be 142,474 $/year, of which equipment investment is 71,292 $/year and electricity is 71,182 $/year. Sulfuric acid and TBAOH can be recovered with 315.1 ton/year and 37.40 ton/year, respectively.

AB  - A solar-driven V3+/2+(aq,H2SO4)IKOH(aq) cell, consisting of a carbon-cloth cathode in 2.0 M H2SO4 (aq) with 0.36 M V-2(SO4)(3) (pH -0.16), a Ni mesh anode in 2.5 M KOH(aq) (pH 14.21) for the oxygenevolution reaction (OER), and a bipolar membrane that sustained the pH differentials between the catholyte and anolyte, enabled water splitting with spatial and temporal decoupling of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from the OER and produced H-2(g) locally under pressure upon demand. Over a range of potentials and charging depths, V3+ was selectively reduced with >99.8% faradic efficiency. The V2+ species produced in the catholyte was then passed subsequently on demand over a MoCx-based HER catalyst to produce H-2 (g) and regenerate V(3+ )for subsequent reduction. Under a base hydrogen pressure of 1, 10, and 100 atm, the discharge efficiency of the V3+ to hydrogen was 83%, 65.2%, and 59.8%, respectively. In conjunction with a solar tracker and a photovoltaic device, the V3+/ 2+ (aq,H2SO4)IKOH(aq) cell was charged outdoors under sunlight and discharged at night with a daily averaged energy conversion efficiency of 3.7% and a STH conversion efficiency of 5.8% during diurnal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) daylight operation.

AB  - Zn-air battery uses oxygen from the air, and hence, air holes in it are kept open for cell operation. Therefore, loss of water by evaporation through the holes is inevitable. When the water is depleted, the battery ceases to operate. There are two water consumption routes in Zn-air batteries, namely, active path (electrolysis) and passive path (evaporation and corrosion). Water loss by the active path (electrolysis) is much faster than that by the passive path during the early stage of the cycles. The mass change by the active path slows after 10 h. In contrast, the passive path is largely constant, becoming the main mass loss path after 10 h. The active path contributes to two-thirds of the electrolyte consumption in 24 h of cell operation in 4.0 M KOH. Although water is an important component for the cell, water vapor does not influence the cell operation unless the water is nearly depleted. However, high oxygen concentration favors the discharge reaction at the cathode.

AB  - The development of low-cost, high-activity, and pH universal catalysts is essential in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via industrial electrolysis of water. Here, we report the rapid and scalable preparation of defect-rich copper catalysts as electrocatalysts for all-pH HER by electric discharge in liquid (EDL) technology. The defects upshift the d-band center of copper, improve water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, and ultimately improve the intrinsic catalytic activity. Thus, the overpotentials of Cu catalysts reach 180 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 269 mV in 1 M PBS, and 152 mV at 10 m A cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. In addition, the Cu catalysts also exhibit lower overpotentials at high current density (1 A cm(-2)), superior to commercial Pt/C in neutral and alkaline solutions.

AB  - The renewable energy utilization largely relies on the development of highly efficient energy conversion devices including metal-air batteries and water electrolyzers. Currently, it is crucial yet challenging to explore multifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts with high activity toward oxygen and hydrogen electrodes. Herein, unique donut-shaped hybrid nanostructure composed of interconnected CoP nanoparticles within P, N co-doped carbon matrix (denoted as CoP@PNC-DoS) was successfully fabricated through a supramolecular assisted one-pot strategy. Thanks to the unique morphology and modulated composition, the CoP@PNC-DoS manifested excellent universal electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen and hydrogen electrodes, where a small potential gap of 0.781 V (Delta E = E-j10-E-1/2) between ORR and OER and a low overpotential of 173 and 160 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER can be achieved. The CoP@PNC-DoS based Zn-air battery could provide an impressive peak power density of 138.57 mW cm(-2), and more importantly, a prominent charge/discharge stability after 150 h/350 cycles under a current density of 30 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its feasibility as cathode electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. More importantly, a proof-of-concept system integrating Zn-air battery powered water splitting was further built to achieve cost-effective H-2 production.

AB  - This study explored the nondestructive hydrophilic modification of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) fabrics via the codeposition of catechol (CA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), followed by plasma-initiated graft polymerization of sodium allylsulfonate (ALS). Surface morphology and elemental composition analyses of the modified fabrics were performed via Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which confirmed their successful surface modification. Optimal hydrophilicity modification was achieved with a CA/PEI ratio of 1:2, an ALS concentration of 0.5 mol/L, and a discharge power of 80 W. Using the modified PPS fabrics as membranes in alkaline water electrolyzers considerably enhanced the electrochemical performance and increased the maximum current density from 258.6 to 356.7 mA/cm2. The fabrics also exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and long-term stability. This novel method presents a promising approach for fabric surface modification, with potential applications in alkaline electrolytic cell diaphragms in the future.

AB  - The development of mass-market electric vehicles (EVs) using lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is helping to propel growth in LIB usage, but end-of-life strategies for UBs are not well developed. An important aspect of waste LIB processing is the stabilisation of such high energy-density devices, and energy discharge is an obvious way to achieve this. Salt-water electrochemical discharge is often mentioned as the initial step in many LIB recycling studies, but the details of the process itself have not often been mentioned. This study presents systematic discharge characteristics of different saline and basic solutions using identical, fully charged LIB cells. A total of 26 different ionic solutes with sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and ammonium (NH4+) cations have been tested here using a fixed weight percentage concentration. An evaluation of possible reactions has also been carried out here. The results show good discharge for many of the salts, without significant damaging visual corrosion. The halide salts (CI-, Br-, and I-) show rapid corrosion of the positive terminal, as does sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), and the solution penetrates the cell can. Mildly acidic solutions do not appear to cause significant damage to the cell can. The most alkaline solutions (NaOH and K3PO4) appear to penetrate the cell without any clear visual damage at the terminals. Depending on what is desired by the discharge (i.e. complete cell destruction and stabilisation or potential re-use or materials recovery), discharge of individual Li-ion cells using aqueous solutions holds clear promise for scaled-up and safe industrial processes.

AB  - Achieving a high working potential window beyond the water electrolysis limit ( > 1.23 V) has always been a big challenge in the fabrication of aqueous supercapacitors (SCs). Since energy density has quadratic dependence on voltage, broadening of cell voltage can remarkably increase the energy density of the capacitor. Unfortunately, most of the aqueous electrochemical capacitors operated in strongly acidic or alkaline electrolytes show poor energy densities owing to their narrow operating voltage limit. To obtain a high voltage range of aqueous symmetric carbon/carbon capacitors and achieve high energy density, the chemistry of electrode materials and the electrochemical kinetics of electrolytes play a critical role. Hence, in the present work, we explore a porous activated carbon produced from the seeds of Manilkara zapota (ACMZ-700) in combination with sulfuric acid electrolyte to obtain an encouraging electrochemical stable working voltage window. Thus, the resulting symmetric SC effectively exhibited an enlarged cell voltage of 1.5 V in an acidic medium. Importantly, due to the positive role of oxygenated surface functional groups of the ACMZ-700 active material, the fabricated symmetric cell delivered an attractive specific capacitance of 334 F g( -1) @ 1 A/g. As a result of high capacitance and broader working voltage, the symmetric device delivered an excellent energy density of 26 Wh kg( -1) at a power density of 748 W kg( -1) and held excellent cycling stability over 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.

AB  - Several as-cast, binary Mg-Ni and ternary Mg-Ni-Mm (Mm = mischmetal) alloys were studied with respect to hydrogen storage. The alloys were hydrided using a new, electrochemical process to find the most promising alloy. The electrochemical hydriding process consisted of the electrolysis of a 6-M KOH solution in which the hydrided alloy was the cathode. The structures of both the as-cast and hydrided alloys were investigated by light microscopy, electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The hydrogen concentration was measured using glow-discharge spectrometry. It was observed that the structures of all the studied alloys contained a significant volume fraction of disperse eutectic mixtures that represented good paths for the inward hydrogen diffusion. The maximum hydrogen mass concentration of 1.6 % was thus achieved in the Mg-26Ni alloy with an almost purely eutectic structure. In the hypoeutectic and hypereutectic alloys the hydrogen concentrations were lower. The mechanism of the hydriding process is discussed in relation to the observed structural features of the alloys.

AB  - NiO films with amorphous and crystalline structure are prepared via sol-gel method. The electrochromic performances are evaluated in a KOH electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which demonstrates that the crystalline NiO thin film has excellent stability and durability compared with the amorphous film. Meanwhile, the unique method of multi-cycle double-step potential chronocoulometry (MDPC) is firstly employed to analyze the electrochromic performance of the NiO films. It shows that the cyclic tendency obtained from MDPC is consistent with the CV evolutions. The relationship between charge densities and cycles can be directly obtained by MDPC, consequently, the reversibility of films can be directly evaluated by the ratio of the extracted/inserted charges. As a primary advantage, the response charges obtained by MDPC technique can be divided into three parts including Faradic charges (Qf) associated with redox activity leading to chromic change, the capacitive charges (Q(dl)) corresponding to charging and discharging of electrode-electrolyte double-layer capacitor, and parasitic charges (Q(ads)) consumed by electrolysis of adsorbed species. The electrochromic mechanism of NiO films are further explored by analyzing the cycle dependence of Q(f) and Q(ads) evolutions. It adequately supports that MDPC has significant advantage to analyze the electrochromic performance and mechanism of electrochromic materials. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - This study aims at disclosing the effect of small temperature drops (10-15 degrees C) of the electrolyte on Contact Glow Discharge Electrolysis (CGDE). In our experiments, we measure the temperature change of electrolyte and electrode as well as the change in current following on from the addition of, first, frozen and, second, boiling KOH aqueous solution (0.1 M). Quite surprisingly, only the addition of frozen KOH aqueous solution has a significant impact on current (+130%), caused by the decrease in electrolyte temperature (-11 degrees C). In contrast, the addition of boiling KOH aqueous solution has a negligible effect on current. A very similar behavior is recorded when frozen or boiling type III deionized water is used: the addition of ice has an even stronger impact on current (+145 %) and on electrolyte temperature (-14 degrees C), while adding boiling water has no measurable effect. Thus, we here demonstrated that electrolyte temperature is critical for managing the responsiveness of the CGDE system. Our results pave the way toward temperature controlled CGDE, a powerful tool for a greener and a more efficient environmental chemistry.

AB  - With the ongoing transformation of the global energy sector, hydrogen has garnered significant attention as a clean and efficient energy carrier, playing a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the transition to a sustainable energy economy. However, the development of hydrogen technology is confronted with challenges such as cost, efficiency, infrastructure construction, and safety concerns. This study compares the energy consumption of direct current (DC) electrolysis and pulse electrolysis at various frequencies, analyzing the relationship between frequency and energy consumption. Additionally, we examined the bubble behavior and current curves under pulsed and DC electrolysis to elucidate the energy-saving mechanisms of pulsed electrolysis. The experimental results indicate that pulsed electrolysis for hydrogen production consumes significantly less energy than traditional DC methods, achieving a maximum energy saving of 54.43% within an operating voltage range of 6 V-10 V. Compared to conventional DC electrolysis, pulsed electrolysis reduced the number of hydrogen bubbles from 583 to 268 and the average bubble diameter from 38.93 to 28.81 mu m. This reduction in bubble count and size effectively mitigates the overvoltage phenomenon caused by bubble formation. Furthermore, our investigation into the impact of different frequencies on current revealed that high- frequency pulse electrolysis prevents complete double-layer charge and discharge due to its short pulse duration, thereby reducing energy loss from repeated charge-discharge cycles and enhancing electrolytic efficiency.

AB  - Nanoporous Au (NPG) films have promising properties, making them suitable for various applications in (electro)catalysis or (bio)sensing. Tuning the structural properties, such as the pore size or the surface-to-volume ratio, often requires complex starting materials such as alloys, multiple synthesis steps, lengthy preparation procedures or a combination of these factors. Here we present an approach that circumvents these difficulties, enabling for a rapid and controlled preparation of NPG films starting from a bare Au electrode. In a first approach a Au oxide film is prepared by high voltage (HV) electrolysis in a KOH solution, which is then reduced either electrochemically or in the presence of H2O2. The resulting NPG structures and their electrochemically active surface areas strongly depend on the reduction procedure, the concentration and temperature of the H2O2-containing KOH solution, as well as the applied voltage and temperature during HV electrolysis. Secondly, the NPG film can be prepared directly by applying voltages that result in anodic contact glow discharge electrolysis (aCGDE). By carefully adjusting the corresponding parameters, the surface area of the final NPG film can be specifically controlled. The structural properties of the electrodes are investigated by means of XPS, SEM and electrochemical methods.

AB  - The development of Zn-air batteries with a high energy density of 1350 W h kg(-1) is one of the breakthroughs required to achieve a low carbon society. However, morphology control of the Zn negative electrode during charge/discharge (Zn-deposition/stripping) is essential for practical application. Considering the manufacturing process, a simple strategy is preferable. Herein, we employed surfactants as an inhibitor of the formation of mossy and dendrite Zn structures, and studied electrochemical Zn growth from the perspective of the electric charge of the surfactant. Even by using an additive free electrolyte of 0.25 M ZnO + 4 M KOH and with 1 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS: anionic surfactant) or polyacrylic acid (PAA: non-ionic surfactant), mossy and dendrite formations were unavoidable irrespective of the current density. On the other hand, a cationic surfactant, trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (STAC), suppressed the shape change and resulted in a smooth and dense morphology. Zeta potential measurements, kinetic current densities observed from Tafel plots, and constant potential electrolysis indicate that quaternary ammonium cations (STAC) with bulky size adsorb onto protrusions which are the cause of shape change and suppress Zn deposition in the region to promote lateral growth. Although the adsorption of STAC increased the average overvoltage for Zn-deposition/stripping in a symmetric Zn vertical bar Zn cell under a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), significantly stable behavior continued for 200 h. In contrast, the overvoltage of the additive free system suddenly increased after 156 h, associated with the accumulation of insulating ZnO and Zn(OH)(2) formed on the Zn surface. In charge-discharge tests using an asymmetric Cu vertical bar Zn cell, the coulombic efficiency in the additive free electrolyte was less than 95%, whereas the addition of STAC at 1 mM achieved superior cycling performance without any capacity loss originating from the generation of dead Zn (electrical isolation). These results demonstrate that the addition of STAC is a promising method of controlling the Zn morphology.

AB  - This paper studies production of micron-sized metal particles by plasma electrolysis (PE) using an electrolytic cell with DC current up to 3 A and voltage up to 300 V. A formation of hydrogen plasma on a cathode resulted in electrodes erosion. The PE method was used for the micron-sized metal particles production and potassium hydroxide was used as an electrolyte. The experiments were carried out with different concentrations of KOH (0.125-0.625 wt%). We investigated KOH concentration on the PE regime and, thus, on the size distribution of particles obtained from the plasma-eroded cathode. Particles obtained by PE were comprehensively analysed; particle size distribution curves for powders obtained in different conditions were compared. Particle size distribution curves were shifted to the nano-range with an increased plasma current (KOH concentration). Qualitative energetic estimation of the PE was executed for the open electrolytic cell. Energy balance was used to determine the amount of energy released by the PE.

AB  - Silicon nanoparticles (Si-NPs) were directly synthesized from a Si bar electrode via a solution plasma. In order to produce smaller Si-NPs, the effects of different electrolytes and applied voltages on the product were investigated in the experiments detailed in this paper. The results demonstrated that the use of an acidic solution of 0.1 M HCl or HNO3 produced Si-NPs without SiO2 formation. According to the transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the obtained Si-NPs contained both amorphous and polycrystalline Si particles, among which the smaller Si-NPs tended to be amorphous. When an alkaline solution of K2CO3 was used instead, amorphous SiO2 particles were synthesized owing to the corrosion of Si in the high-temperature environment. The pH values of KCl and KNO3 increased during electrolysis, and the products were partially oxidized in the alkaline solutions. The particle size increased with an increasing applied voltage because the excitation temperature of the plasma increased.

AB  - Various oxide film layers were grown onto AZ31 and AM60 magnesium alloy substrates by microarc anodic oxidation (MAO) in alkaline phosphate solutions with different additives such as silicate, aluminate and tetraborate. Surface morphologies and phase composition of the films were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. The adhesion strength of the anodic oxides was evaluated by scratch testing. The electrolyte composition affects the surface morphology and the adhesion of the oxides to the alloy substrates. The anodising solution consisting of phosphate, tetraborate and silicate produces a better oxides adhesion compared to those achieved in other electrolytic solutions.

AB  - In the current research work, Ni0.2Co2.8O4 and Ni0.2Co2.8/MWCNTs have been synthesized via facile sol-gel and wet impregnation method. The synthesized materials attained the crystalline structures as evident from X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The uniform morphology and well dispersion of Ni0.2Co2.8O4 onto MWCNTs was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical investigations for supercapacitor application by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that, among both materials, Ni0.2Co2.8O4/MWCNTs has high specific capacitance (CV; 505.8 Fg(-1) at 5 mV/s, GCD; 1598 Fg(-1) at 0.5 A/g), greater capacitance retention (85 %) at 1000 cycles and has lower charge transfer resistance (R-ct; 3.48 Omega cm(2)). These findings reflected the potential candidacy of Ni0.2Co2.8O4/MWCNTs to be used as anode material in supercapacitor. Further investigations by CV and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in 1.0 M KOH showed comparatively low over potential of 340 mV @100 mA/cm(2) for the same integrated material. Additionally, the lower Tafel slope (47 mV/dec) and solution resistance authenticated it as an appropriate electrocatalyst for OER in water splitting. The CPE (controlled potential electrolysis) revealed the stability of both materials for OER in water oxidation.

AB  - Developing the tri-functional catalysts to facilitate the oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction and hydrogen evo-lution reactions (OER, ORR and HER) is meaningful for zinc-air batteries (ZABs) and water splitting. Herein, we construct a novel metal sulfide heterostructure (INF-FeCuS) composed of Cu7S4 and Fe0.95S1.05. INF-FeCuS ex-hibits the superior tri-functional catalytic property with the OER, ORR and HER potentials of 1.45 V at 100 mA cm-2, 0.68 V at 10 mA cm-2, 292 mV at 100 mA cm-2 respectively. INF-FeCuS with a high ion conversion ability also can be used in the alkaline zinc battery with a discharge specific capacity of 446.0 mAh/g. Using the four -functional INF-FeCuS, we can fabricate a new-type of alkaline hybrid zinc battery (AHZB) with a peak power density of 203.4 mW cm-2 and energy efficiency of over 70 %. Interestingly, a single AHZB with INF-FeCuS can drive the electrolyzer with INF-FeCuS to produce hydrogen.

AB  - The application of 50 VDC cathodic contact glow discharge electrolysis for six hours in 1.0 mol/L KOH + 0.8, 0.4 and 0.08 g/L ammonia results in the removal of 66, 71 and 77% of ammonia, respectively, following pseudo first-order kinetics at ca. 0.3 mol/kWh. The yields of dissolved NO2-N and NO3-N lie between 9 and 29% and are coupled with ammonia removal suggesting a nitrification process. Based on the near-cathode UV-Vis emissions and ionization products of H2O and NH3 molecules, a mechanism is proposed along with the charge/energy transfer reactions between the plasma-generated free radicals and ionic species. Joule heating and vaporization are also believed to physically remove ammonia.

AB  - 102 samples were treated by the micro arc oxidation at different bipolar pulsing periods in the alkaline silicate electrolyte. The obtained results demonstrated that the duty cycle has no correlation with the layer growth or the surface roughness. The results were analyzed by the multiple linear regression and then the proper diagrams for thickness and roughness were plotted. The growth mechanism of the ceramic coating was influenced by many complicated and interrelated factors. We suggested a new mechanism to describe the resultant coating phenomenon taking into account the different reactions during the four periods of bipolar pulsing mode. The plasma discharge generator, anodic period, affected significantly in the layer growth and the surface roughness. The cathodic period affected the growth by the etching-protection effect, and affected the surface morphology by the production of hydrogen gaseous sheath. The contribution of the anodic neutral period was caused by the internal etching. The cathodic neutral period significantly affected the surface roughness by releasing the cathodic-hydrogen gaseous sheath, and contributed in the layer growth. The phase formation was also described by the suggested mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - LaCoO3-delta (LCO) based perovskites including LaCr0.5Co0.5O3-delta (LCCO), LaFe0.5Co0.5O3-delta (LFCO) and LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-delta (LCFCO) were prepared and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity was studied. The presence of both Cr and Fe played vital roles in enhancing activity, affecting structural and electronic properties respectively. Cr doping was associated with surface oxygen vacancy formation whilst Fe doping enhanced the onset and half-wave potential. Furthermore, the effects of calcinating temperatures were explored and LCFCO fired at 700 degrees C (LCFCO-700) gave superior activity. Remarkably, when LCFCO-700 was employed in a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC), an OCV of 0.72 V and a maximum current density of similar to 320 mAcm(-2) was achieved when using air as the oxidant. Under similar conditions, DAFCs with LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-delta/C cathode, show comparable performance to the DAFC using Pt/C cathode, indicating that perovskite oxides, such as LaCr0.25Fe0.25Co0.5O3-delta, are promising non-noble cathodes for DAFCs.

AB  - Non faradaic yields of anodic contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) originate through H-center dot and OH center dot radical generated during the process. Scavenging effects of Fe(CN) (6) (4-) on OH center dot radicals, in alkaline media have been investigated. A kinetic analysis of the competing reactions of O- with different species in the system leads to an yield of 9.8 mol mol electron(-1) of OH center dot and H-center dot radicals each in the liquid phase reaction zone of anodic CGDE in good agreement with the yield reported from a study involving H-center dot radical scavengers.

AB  - Chlor-alkali electrolysis with oxygen depolarized cathode (ODC), which can save up to 30 % in energy, primarily involves two electrochemical reactions: the chlorine evolution reaction (CER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, electrocatalysts used in this field is the platinum-group metals (PGMs), which significantly increase the preparation cost. Herein, we synthesize Fe single-atom anchored on carbon nanotubes (Fe-N@CNTs) via a pre-coordination strategy as an active and durable ORR catalyst. The resulting Fe-N@CNTs displays excellent ORR performance with a large half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.905 V and excellent durability over 30,000 CV test in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Projected density of states (PDOS) analysis demonstrates that geometric strain lowers the d-band center of Fe, weakening the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates at FeN4 active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that geometric strain effects reduce the potential determining step (PDS) energy barrier and optimize the binding strength of *OH of ORR. Both Fe-N@CNTs-based aqueous Zn-air battery (A-ZAB) and quasi-solid-state Zn-air battery (QSS-ZAB) display excellent charge/discharge cycling stability with small charge/discharge voltage gaps over 1700 h and 100 h, respectively. Importantly, Fe-N@CNTs||RuO2 chlor-alkali flow cell requires low cell potential of 1.58 V to reach 300 mA cm(-2) at 80 degrees C, and delivers excellent stability over 230 and 110 h at 100 and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively. Fe-N@CNTs||RuO2 maintains approximately 100 % caustic current efficiency at the current density of 300 mA cm(-2). This work contributes to the development of stable, uniformly dispersed atomic-scale metal ORR catalysts and expands their applications in chlor-alkali electrolyzer.

AB  - It remains a huge challenge to design and realize trifunctional high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, with the introduction of CdS and ferrocene, a metalorganic framework (MOF)-induced strategy is reported to synthesize a hierarchical trifunctional electrocatalyst based on Co/CoS nanoparticles and metal (Co, Fe)-N-C species in a hairy S, N-codoped mesoporous carbon polyhedron interwoven with carbon nanotubes (Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC). The specific roles of Co, CoS and (Co, Fe)-N-C active species in Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC catalyst for ORR, OER and HER are also well recognized. Besides, CdS nanoparticles is demonstrated to act as a pore former and S sources both for reaction and doping, and ferrocene is employed to initiate the in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes and Fe-N-C active sites which both contribute to superior multifunctional activities. Benefitting from the rationally designed nanostructures, the ORR half-potential of the Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC electrocatalyst reaches 0.906 V in 0.1 M KOH, about 65 mV larger than commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, and a low overpotential of 250 mV is achieved for OER and 138 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Constructed with the Co/CoS/Fe-HSNC catalyst, a Zn-air battery exhibits a high power density of 213 mW cm(-2) and a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.79 V at 2.0 mA cm(-2). The presented strategy provides new insight into the construction of MOF-derived hierarchical multifunctional catalysts for Zn-air batteries and water electrolysis.

AB  - This work aims at analyzing an integrated system of a zinc-air flow battery with a zinc electrolyzer for energy storage application. For efficient utilization of inherently intermittent renewable energy sources, safe and cost-effective energy storage systems are required. A zinc-air flow battery integrated with a zinc electrolyzer shows great promise as an electricity storage system due to its high specific energy density at low cost. A mathematical model of the system was developed. The model was implemented in MATLAB and validated against experimental results. The validation of the model was verified by the agreement between the simulation and experimental polarization characteristic. The behavior and performance of the system were then examined as a function of different operating parameters: the flow rate of the electrolyte, the initial concentration of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the initial concentration of zincate ion. These parameters significantly affected the performance of the system. The influence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the performance of the system was investigated and discussed as it significantly affected the coulombic efficiencies of both the zinc-air flow battery and the zinc electrolyzer. Optimal KOH concentration was found to be about 6-7 M. Whilst increased KOH concentration enhanced the discharge energy of the battery, it also increased HER of both the battery and the electrolyzer. However, higher initial concentration of zincate ion reduced HER and improved the coulombic efficiency of the system. Besides, a higher flow rate of electrolyte enhanced the performance of the system especially at a high charge/discharge current by maintaining the concentration of active species in the cell. Nevertheless, the battery suffered from a higher rate of HER at a high flow rate. It was noted that the model-based analysis provided better insight into the behavioral characteristics of the system leading to an improved design and operation of the integrated system of zinc-air flow battery with the zinc electrolyzer.

AB  - To address the shortage of fossil fuels and planetary pollution, developing sustainable multifunctional electrode materials capable of simultaneous satisfying energy conversion (HER and OER) and storage (pseudocapacitive) applications has become critically imperative. In this study, MoS2@NiFe-LDH composite electrode was successfully synthesized through electrochemical deposition of MoS2 nanoparticles onto exfoliated NiFe-LDH nanosheets. The composited material demonstrated unique structural advantages, including an ultrathin layered morphology, abundant electroactive sites, enhanced conductivity, and optimized electronic configuration, which collectively contributed to its superior electrochemical performance. The composite functioned efficiently as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, demonstrating outstanding performance in catalyzing, achieving low overpotentials of 91 mV (HER) and 188 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm- 2. When employed in an alkaline aqueous electrolyzer, the device achieved 10 mA cm- 2 at 1.58 V in 1 M KOH, achieving excellent catalytic efficiency for overall water splitting. For energy storage applications, the electrode yielded impressive areal capacitance of 5.04 F cm- 2 at 2 mA cm-2 while maintaining 100 % coulombic efficiency even after 8000 repeated charging and discharging operations. Delivering a power density of 8 mW cm- 2, the device maintained an energy density as high as 0.45 mWh cm- 2. The undertaking described herein revealed the potential of MoS2@NiFe-LDH as an efficient and multifunctional electrode material for energy storage and conversion, and provided valuable insights into the design strategies of nanomaterials for sustainable energy technologies.

AB  - Cathodic microarc plasma electrolysis (CMPE) method was employed to degrade phenol in wastewater. The effects of electrode material, bath voltage, initial pH value and supporting electrolyte on phenol degradation were investigated. The plasma discharge was characterized by Optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The phenol concentration and its main intermediate products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and its removal efficiency were also evaluated. The results illustrated that the Ti cathode degraded phenol more effectively than the Pt cathode due to the higher electron temperature in plasma discharge envelope and catalytic properties on Ti cathode. The electron temperature increased with increasing of bath voltage, which promoted the degradation of the phenol. Higher voltage enhanced the production and decomposition of intermediate products forward. For the pH value of electrolyte, alkaline condition was preferred to neutral and acidic conditions to improve degradation efficiency. Meanwhile, the chloride ion in the electrolyte promoted the ring-cleave reaction enormously.

AB  - Molten salt electrolysis has been widely used in the production and separation of metals, but it still lacks in situ real-time analysis methods to monitor the electrolysis process. In this work, a microplasma spectroscopic real-time analysis (MIPECA) system is developed based on noncontact direct current (DC) glow discharge. With the MIPECA system, the atomic emission spectroscopy of Li and K could be obtained in situ in LiCl-KCl molten salt, and the impact of different operating conditions on spectral signals was investigated. Then, the characteristic spectra of ten representative elements, including alkali metals (Na, Cs), alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), transition metals (Ag, Cu, Ni), and lanthanide metals (Ce), were all successfully excited for qualitative analysis. Under the optimal operating conditions, quantitative analysis of Ag, Cs, and Sr was achieved with high sensitivity and low limits of detection (LOD) of about 0.063, 0.021, and 0.073 wt %, respectively. Finally, the electrolysis process of Ag+ in LiCl-KCl molten salt was real-time monitored by using this MIPECA system, showing its application potential in molten salt electrolysis.

AB  - The present study investigates the feasibility of coupling the intermittent electric power generation from a wind farm with alkaline electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen. A physically accurate model of commercial elec-trolytic modules has been first developed, accounting for conversion efficiency drop due to modules' cool down, effects of shutdowns due to the intermittence of wind power, and voltage degradation over the working time frame. The model has been calibrated on real modules, for which industrial data were available. Three com-mercial module sizes have been considered, i.e., 1, 2 and 4 MW. As a second step, the model has been coupled with historical power datasets coming from a real wind farm, characterized by a nominal installed power of 13.8 MW. Finally, the model was implemented within a sizing algorithm to find the best combination between the actual wind farm power output and the electrolyzer capacity to reach the lowest Levelized Cost Of Hydrogen (LCOH) possible. To this end, realistic data for the capital cost of the whole system (wind farm and electrolyzers) have been considered, based on industrial data and market reports, as well as maintenance costs including both periodic replacements of degraded components and periodic maintenance. Simulations showed that, if the right sizing of the two systems is made, competitive hydrogen production costs can be achieved even with current technologies. Bigger modules are less flexible but, by now, considerably cheaper than smaller ones. A future economy of scale in alkaline electrolyzers is then needed to foster the diffusion of the technology.

KW  - STABILITY
AB  - In recent years, polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes have been proposed for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) as an alternative to perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid membranes such as Nafion (TM). Despite their excellent capacity retention, PBI membranes tend to suffer from a low ionic conductivity. The formation of a polybenzimidazolium through an N-alkylation of the benzimidazole core is shown to improve the ionic conductivity of the membrane, with this class of materials having found uses in alkaline fuel cell and water electrolysis systems. However, much less is known about their incorporation into a VRFB. This article describes the use of hexamethyl-p-terphenyl polybenzimidazolium (HMT-PMBI) membranes for a vanadium redox flow battery, with the membrane characteristics in acidic media being related to their performance in a single-cell VRFB setup. A change of the degree of methylation from 56 to 65, 75, and 89% leads to an increase in ionic conductivity, correlated with an increased fraction of free water in the ionomer. The corresponding increase in cell performance is, however, accompanied by a drop in capacity retention. The membrane with a degree of methylation of 65% shows balanced properties, with a 5% higher efficiency and a two times improved capacity retention compared to Nafion (TM) NR212 over 200 charge-discharge cycles at 200 mA cm-2.
   Hexamethyl-p-terphenyl polybenzimidazolium (HMT-PMBI) for a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). A higher degree of methylation increases the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte but reduces its capacity retention in a VRFB.

AB  - Highly flexible and compressible biomass-derived freestanding monoliths are directly utilized as binder-and substrate-free tri-functional electrodes for the wearable electronic devices. The introduction of Co nanoparticles, nanoclusters, and single atoms onto biomass-derived monoliths leads to the additional growth of CNTs for ensuring the interconnectivity of 3D cellulose-derived carbon network. Thus, superb flexibility and/or compressibility as well as high-efficiency tri-functional activity are achieved simultaneously. The alkaline water electrolyzer with monolithic electrodes requires only a potential of 1.56 V to generate hydrogen at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for over 120 h. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state zinc-air batteries(ZABs) exhibit a high peak power density of 175.5 mW cm(-2), and an optimal charge-discharge overpotential with a remarkably small voltage gap (delta V) of 0.27 V at 5 mA cm(-2). The excellent charge-discharge cycle stability even under bending and compression conditions demonstrates its high potential for emerging next-generation electronics devices.

AB  - Exhaustive indole oxidation in aqueous solution was studied using contact glow discharge plasma. The results indicated that the rate of indole degradation increases with the decrease in the solution conductivity. The degradation rate can be enhanced under the following situations. First, the increase in temperature. Second, introduce active carbon and hydrogen peroxide to the solution. Third, the degradation process is performed in alkaline or acidic media rather than the neutral media. Fourth, add Fe2+ to solution to undergo Fenton's reaction. However, n-butanol was found decelerate the degradation of indole. Some major intermediates produced during the degradation were detected by using both HPLC and GC-MS.

AB  - Highly efficient and green ammonia production is an important demand for modern agriculture. In this study, a two-step ammonia production method is developed using a gliding arc discharge in combination with Cu/Cu2O electrocatalysis. In this method, NOx is provided by the gliding arc discharge and then electrolyzed by Cu/Cu2O after alkaline absorption. The electrical characteristics, the optical characteristics and the NOx production are investigated in discharges at different input voltage and the gas flow. The dependence of ammonia production through Cu/Cu2O electrocatalysis on pH value and reduction potential are determined by colorimetric method. In our study, two discharge modes are observed. At high input voltage and low gas flow, the discharge is operated with a stable plasma channel which is called the steady arc gliding discharge mode (A-G mode). As lowering input voltage and raising gas flow, the plasma channel is destroyed and high frequency breakdown occurs instead, which is known as the breakdown gliding discharge mode (B-G mode). The optimal NOx production of 7.34 mmol h(-1) is obtained in the transition stage of the two discharge modes. The ammonia yield reaches 0.402 mmol h(-1) cm(-2) at pH value of 12.7 and reduction potential of -1.0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

AB  - The electrochemical behavior ofm-nitrosulphonic acid of benzene was studied by polarography, voltammetry at glassy carbon electrode, electrolysis at the controlled potential, and electrolysis in galvanostatic mode. A distinguishing feature of them-nitrosulphonic acid of benzene electroreduction, as compared with that of aromatic nitro-compounds, both on mercury dropping electrode and glassy carbon electrode, is shown to be a strong dependence of parameters and shape of the polarization curve on the supporting electrolyte solution composition and pH in neutral and alkaline solutions. The two waves observed are bound to the reduction of undissociatedm-nitrosulphonic acid of benzene molecule and its anion; the reduction intermediately product is hydroxylaminesulphonic acid of benzene. The wave of its further reduction tom-aminosulfonic acid of benzene is camouflaged by the supporting-electrolyte discharge. Ammoniac-buffered solutions can be recommended for preparative electrosynthesis ofm-aminosulfonic acid of benzene because its yield in the electrolysis at nickel cathode in galvanostatic mode in these solutions is as high as 92.8%, with current efficiency of 82.0%.

AB  - Applying an external potential difference between two electrodes leads to a voltage drop in an ion conducting electrolyte. This drop is particularly large in poorly conducting electrolytes and for high currents. Measuring the electrolyte potential is relevant in electrochemistry, e.g., bipolar electrochemistry, ohmic microscopy, or contact glow discharge electrolysis. Here, we study the course of the electrolyte potential during high voltage electrolysis in an electrolysis cell using two reversible hydrogen electrodes as reference electrodes, placed at different positions in the electrolyte. The electrolysis is performed with a Pt working and stainless steel counter electrode in a KOH solution. A computational COMSOL model is devised which supports the experimentally obtained potential distribution. The influence of the cell geometry on the electrolyte potentials is evaluated. Applying the knowledge of the potential distribution to the formation of a Au oxide surface structure produced during high voltage electrolysis, we find that the amount of oxide formed is related to the current rather than the applied voltage.

AB  - A targeteddefect-induced strategy of metal sites in a porous frameworkis an efficient avenue to improve the performance of a catalyst. However,achieving such an activation without destroying the ordered frameworkis a major challenge. Herein, a dielectric barrier discharge plasmacan etch the Fe(CN)(6) group of the NiFe Prussian blue analogueframework in situ through reactive oxygen species generated in theair. Density functional theory calculations prove that the changedlocal electronic structure and coordination environment of Fe sitescan significantly improve oxygen evolution reaction catalytic properties.The modified NiFe Prussian blue analogue is featured for only 316mV at a high current density (100 mA cm(-2)), whichis comparable to that of commercial alkaline catalysts. In a solarcell-driven alkaline electrolyzer, the overall electrolysis efficiencyis up to 64% under real operation conditions. Over 80 h long-timecontinuous test under 100 mA cm(-2) highlights superiordurability. The density functional theory calculations confirm thatthe formation of OOH* is the rate-determining step over Fe sites,and Fe(CN)(6) vacancy and extra oxygen atoms can introducecharge redistribution to the catalyst surface, which finally enhancesthe oxygen evolution reaction catalytic properties by reducing theoverpotential by 0.10 V. Both experimental and theoretical resultssuggest that plasma treatment strategy is useful for modifying theskeletal material nondestructively at room temperature, which opensup a broad prospect in the field of catalyst production.
   Dielectric barrier discharge plasma canetch NiFe PBA insitu through reactive oxygen species generated in air. The frameworkstructure can be preserved to the maximum extent. Benefiting fromthe modulated local electronic structure and coordination environmentof Fe sites, the etched NiFe PBA exhibits high catalytic performanceand superior stability for oxygen evolution reaction. In a HER & PAR;OERelectrolysis cell, the voltage is 1.99 V at 100 mA cm(-2), operating continuously for & SIM;83 h.

AB  - For practical applications in electrochemical devices such as zinc air batteries and alkaline water electrolyzers, an efficient electrode design with satisfactory multifunctional catalytic activity is a pivotal prerequisite. Herein, a self-supporting monolithic electrode for electrocatalyst-based devices with exceptionally high multi-functional catalytic activity is presented. The optimized tri-functional activity is recorded at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with an overpotential at 36 mV for HER, and 229 mV for OER, indicating 1.51 V in an alkaline water electrolyzer, as well as a half-wave potential of 0.858 V for ORR. More importantly, the catalyst electrode exhibits an extremely low charge-discharge potential gap (Delta E less than 0.5 V) in solid-state rechargeable zinc-air batteries, attributed to its monolithic characteristics. Consequently, a self-powered hydrogen production system is driven by the identical pieces of the CoNC monoliths and zinc foil as a power source.

Two levels of configurational states are identified: a global N-shaped negative differential resistance, with an embedded S-shaped behavior in a hysteresis loop around the critical voltage the voltage at which the system switches its behavior from conventional electrolysis to glow discharge electrolysis. The S-shaped nonlinearity is attributed to the dynamic self-assembled space charge system formed by the gas film on the one hand, and the glow-emitting electrode on the other hand, and acts as a parasitic energy storage element. Electrical models for the current-voltage behavior based on tanh(x) nonlinearity are presented and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we used cathodic microarc plasma electrolysis (CMPE) to degrade 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in simulated wastewater. By investigating and comparing the removal efficiencies and chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the degradation process, higher bath voltage and alkaline condition were considered as more suitable for the 2,4-DCP decomposition. Higher initial 2,4-DCP concentration was attributed to the increase in the utilisation of the energy input. The plasma characteristics during CMPE were studied by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). It was found that the 2,4-DCP directly participated in the plasma discharge process. Furthermore, by studying the evolution of intermediate products at different experimental parameters, it was found that the existence of Cl(-)played an important role in the opening of benzene ring, which activated the ortho-substitutions of hydroxyl, meanwhile accelerated the p-substitutions. The instantaneous high temperature and high pressure and the Cl(-)that were generated and driven by cathodic plasma made the decomposition of 2,4-DCP much quicker.

AB  - Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) was prepared from manganese cake, which is an oxide material and byproduct obtained during processing of manganese nodules. Manganese cake dissolution was carried out in sulfuric acid media using waste newspaper as a reductant. In the two-stage purification of leach liquor iron was initially removed by pH adjustment using lime slurry followed by sulfide precipitation using sodium sulfide. Effects of current density. Mn(II) and sulfuric add concentrations were studied during the electrodeposition of EMD from purified solution. The EMD obtained was characterized by XRD, SEM and its discharge capacity was determined. The XRD pattern demonstrated that EMD was a mixture of gamma- and epsilon-variety. The EMD produced from manganese cake showed a discharge capacity of 290 mAh/g, which is industrially acceptable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An environmentally friendly method for the one-step electrochemical synthesis of water dispersible graphene directly from graphite is reported. Sulfonated poly(ether-ether-ketone) (SPEEK) dissolved in deionised water was used as an electrolyte and a surface modifying agent for graphene. The effects of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) on the production yield and electrochemical performance of graphene were investigated in detail. The production yield of few-layer graphene increased to above 40%, as compared to the 6% in the absence of NaOH. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses suggested that the oxygen functionalities (hydroxyl and carboxyl) generated during the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in the absence of NaOH were decreased significantly during the electrolysis experiment in an alkaline solution of SPEEK. This is attributed to the NaOH induced reduction of oxygen functionalities present on the surface of graphene sheets. XPS elemental analysis also confirmed the removal of oxygen functionalities in an alkaline medium during the graphite exfoliation experiment. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses confirmed the formation of single layer functionalized graphene. A charge-discharge experiment showed that the specific capacitance of the as-prepared graphene in the absence of NaOH was 18 F g(-1) at a current density of 2.2 A g(-1). In contrast, the specific capacitance was increased to 244 F g(-1) for graphene prepared under alkaline condition indicating its suitability as an energy storage electrode material. The high electrochemical performance may be due to the large surface area of graphene (433 m(2) g(-1)) prepared under alkaline condition as observed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis.

AB  - Plasma electrolysis (PE) is a combination of electrolysis and plasma discharge. Previous studies indicated that PE usually created porous surface with irregular morphology as a result of the plasma-cathode interaction that was dominated by physical reactions. This paper demonstrated that highly ordered textured silicon surfaces could be created using PE. This abnormal anisotropic etching phenomenon implied that the chemical reactions were decoupled from the physical processes and the physical reactions were suppressed. Raman spectra confirmed that the textured silicon surface created by PE conserved the crystalline structure. Therefore, PE may lead to new process regimes for surface engineering.

AB  - The electro-catalyzed oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are the key elements of many energy conversion systems, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Structural design of durable non-noble nanomaterials as bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts is a major drawback to commercial applications. Herein, we exposed a strongly coupled hybrid material comprising of NiFeP-cubes nanoparticles supported on three-dimensional interconnected Fe,N-decorated carbon (3D-FeNC) as a robust bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst. The strongly coupled NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst shows better electron and mass transfer capability, exposure of abundant ORR/OER active sites on the surface, and strongly coupled effects. Accordingly, the as-prepared NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst exhibits robust ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and OER performance (over-potential 0.25 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Significantly, the oxygen electrode prepared from the NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst further demonstrated superior charge/discharge behavior and long-lasting rechargeability than the benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst in rechargeable zinc-O-2 batteries. This approach opens up a new avenue for the synthesis and advanced the hybrid nanomaterials for various applications.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution of soils has become a serious environmental problem. Soil washing with degradable reagents is an effective remediation technique of heavy metal pollution, and the generated leachate must be appropriately treated before discharge. However, the existing methods usually have the problems of large consumption of regents, high cost, and secondary pollution. This study proposed a reagent-free electrochemical precipitation method to remove mixed heavy metal ions extracted from soils by citrate using inert electrodes (IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode and graphite cathode). The results showed that the low potential of cathode led to the electrodeposition of Cd; the local alkaline environment provided by electro-mediated water reduction caused the hydrolytic precipitation of Zn and Pb; and the precipitation of Fe washed out from Fe-rich soil resulted in the coprecipitation of As on cathode surface. These combined cathodic precipitation processes decreased the concentrations of toxic heavy metals by over 99.4% after 12 h of electrolysis at 26 mA cm-2. The electrodes exhibited high stability after multiple successive cycles of reuse. The concentrations of As, Zn, Pb and Cd in the leachate decreased to below the limits of industrial wastewater discharge in each cycle, and those in soils could be reduced by 53.8%, 58.8%, 25.5%, and 70.2% at the initial concentrations of 1549, 1016, 310 and 50 mg kg-1, respectively. The heavy metal removal rate increased with increasing current density in the range of 0-52 mA cm-2. This work provides an efficient and sustainable method for the remediation of site soils polluted by mixed heavy metals.

AB  - Although commercial Pt/C catalyst is currently the preferred catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode of a water electrolyzer, large-scale applications in the prospective industries are still constrained severely by its high cost and insufficient durability. Therefore, developing a highly active, pH-universal, low-cost, and robust HER electrocatalyst is a key aspect for promoting the application of green hydrogen energy, but challenging. In this work, highly defective graphene nanospheres were prepared by arc discharge in toluene, and then annealed to form carbon nano onions (CNOs). Three catalysts with excellent pH-universal activities and stabilities, CoPt3@CNOs, CoPt@CNOs, Co3Pt@CNOs, were then prepared by loading Co-Pt alloys with various phases on CNOs using microwave hydrothermal method. Structural characterizations revealed that the uniformly distributed CoPt alloy nanoparticles with an average size of 2.78 nm, the proper bonding between Co and Pt, and the strong confinement effect of CNOs substrate for CoPt nanoparticles brought CoPt@CNOs with optimized HER performance, which is even better than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. CoPt@CNOs required low overpotentials of 33, 36 and 26 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2, and 132, 128 and 43 mV at 100 mA cm- 2 in 1 M KOH, 1 M PBS, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. In addition, the CoPt@CNOs showed excellent stability over the full pH range. More importantly, the Pt content in CoPt@CNOs was only 9.75 wt%, which reduced more than one half compared with 20 wt% in commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study presents an easy and economical approach to fabricate high-efficiency and pH-universal HER catalysts, which provides a great promise for the commercial use of green hydrogen.

AB  - In order to improve the energy efficiency of the Sabatier reactor-based power-to-gas process, molten carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide electrolyzers were installed instead of a conventional amine CO2 capture system and a classical alkaline electrolyzer. The plant is a multi-module prototype with a nominal capacity of 50 kW consisting of two SOE-MCFC units. The system was commissioned in 2022. The article describes the theoretical basis. The initial assumptions that were formulated at the stage of preparing for the research investment, as well as the deviations from them that became the result of detailed design were presented. The developed startup and shutdown procedures, as well as the first results of pioneering research were shown. The trial operation of the system was intended to provide information on integrated SOE-MCFC module and its performance and efficiency. The basic barriers for market implementation and recommendations for future research were discussed. The optimal operating point for hydrogen production needed 35.8 kWh/kgH2. Thus, electrical energy conversion to chemical energy efficiency is 93.9%. Flow preheating and electrical auxiliary heater power are not included. An MCFC at its ideal functioning point (around 4 kWel) outputs 5.4 kg/h of CO2 separated.

AB  - Molten salt CO2 capture and electrochemical transformation (MSCC-ET) process is a desirable method to prepare various carbide materials. In this study, (NbTaTiZrHf)C high-entropy carbide (HEC) nano-sized particles were synthesized by MSCC-ET process, utilizing mixed metal oxides as the raw materials and LiCl-CaCl2-KCl molten salt system as electrolyte. To explore the reactions occurring on the molten salt and electrode surface in the MSCC-ET process, the phase structure, elemental valence states and microstructure of (NbTaTiZrHf)C HEC powders were thoroughly investigated through XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM. The supercapacitor performance was measured by electrochemical workstations. The results reveal that HEC powders display a clustered morphology, with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm. The specific capacitance reaches 63.5 F/g with a scan rate of 100 mV/s in 1 mol/L KOH solution. Remarkably, even after 2500 full charge-discharge cycles, the capacity retention remains at an impressive 89.84 %. The Tafel slope for (NbTaTiZrHf)C registers at a value of 61 mV/dec. This research provides a foundation for the preparation of various carbide materials in an environmentally friendly process.

In this study, efficient debromination and decomposition of BF induced by contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) in a sodium sulfate solution were investigated. Intermediate byproducts were determined by ionic chromatography and gas chromatography, respectively. Experimental results showed that alkaline conditions and additions of organic additives to the solution were favorable for both the removal and the debromination of BF. Oxalic acid, formic acid, dibromomethane and bromate ion were determined as the major intermediate byproducts. Final products were inorganic carbon and bromide ion. Hydrated electrons may be the most likely active species responsible for the initiation of the debromination, and hydroxyl radicals may be the ones for the oxidation of the intermediate byproducts.

AB  - The thermal runaway inside the alkaline water electrolyzer (AWE) of hydrogen production plants threatens the running safety of the plants. Phase change materials (PCMs) with suitable thermal conductivity and shape stability can mitigate the thermal runaway and recover the waste heat of AWE by regulating the temperature of AWE. Additionally, cascade latent heat thermal energy storage (CTES) can further improve the thermal efficiency. In the present study, three types of paraffin wax (PW) with different phase change temperatures were used as PCMs for the application in CTES systems. New composite carrier materials of wasted corn stover with environmental friendly and expanded graphite (EG) were proposed to improve the leakage of liquid PW and enhance the thermal conductivity, respectively. The proportions of composite carrier materials were determined by various characterization tests, whereas the optimal performance was chosen. Subsequently, three types of determined composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were applied to experimentally establish the CTES, which was designed based on the exergy optimization. The thermophysical properties and thermal stabilities of CPCMs were characterized through a series of experiments, as CNCS (carbonised corn stover) 8-EG2/PW (mCNCS: mEG equals to 80:20) was selected as the optimum choice for CPCM. Based on the foundation, a series of experimental investigations were conducted to compare the charging and discharging characteristics of CTES0 and CTES1 devices. The results show that the charging time of CTES1 is only 25 % of that of CTES0 during the charging process, and the inhomogeneous temperature difference of the PCM in CTES1 is only 45 % of that of CTES0 during the discharging process. Current research offers a practical basis for the initial implementation of AWE thermal runaway management and waste heat recovery.

AB  - Reversible Solid Oxide electrolyser (rSOE) is a promising solution for long-duration energy storage due to its exceptional features such as inherent reversibility, co-electrolysis capability in electrolysis mode, high efficiency, adaptability to multiple fuels and the ability to concentrate CO2 in fuel cell mode (SOFC) during the processing of carbon-based fuels. However, its economic viability in power-to-X-to-power (P2X2P) applications remains under-explored. This study evaluates the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of a 250 MW rSOE across six energy storage forms, considering different discharging durations (168-1440 h) and varied annual charging-discharging cycles (1-30). H 2 stored in salt caverns, CH4 stored in gas grids and CH3OH stored in tanks are identified as the most viable storage options. The impact of stack lifetime and degradation on LCOS is also analyzed, revealing that associated benefits in terms of LCOS from extending the stack lifetime are marginal. Furthermore, Capital expenditure (Capex) thresholds for achieving an LCOS target of 0.2 $/kWh are calculated for rSOE scales ranging from 10 MW to 1000 MW under scenarios with discharging durations exceeding 700 h and 1-3 charging-discharging cycles per year. Results indicate that H 2 stored in salt caverns is optimal for smaller scales and shorter discharging durations, while CH4 stored in gas grids becomes more cost-effective at larger scales with longer durations. Also, it is found that there is a minimum deployment scale for rSOE to meet the LCOS target of 0.2 $/kWh. The minimum deployment scale varies with different energy carriers and energy storage scenarios. Moreover, the Capex thresholds to achieve 0.2 $/kWh LCOS for Alkaline Water Electrolyser (AWE) and Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyser (PEMWE) are also uncovered. The results revealed that rSOE outperforms AWE and PEMWE at MW-scale seasonal energy storage due to its reversibility. For carbon-based fuels (CH strates unique advantages, as its reverse SOFC mode inherently enables CO2 concentration, significantly reducing CO2 capture costs. 4 , CH3OH), rSOE demon

AB  - In the standard two-electrode configuration employed in electrolytic process, when the control dc voltage is brought to a critical value, the system undergoes a transition from conventional electrolysis to contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE), which has also been referred to as liquid-submerged micro-plasma, glow discharge plasma electrolysis, electrode effect, electrolytic plasma, etc. The light-emitting process is associated with the development of an irregular and erratic current time-series which has been arbitrarily labelled as "random," and thus dissuaded further research in this direction. Here, we examine the current time-series signals measured in cathodic CGDE configuration in a concentrated KOH solution at different dc bias voltages greater than the critical voltage. We show that the signals are, in fact, not random according to the NIST SP. 800-22 test suite definition. We also demonstrate that post-processing low-pass filtered sequences requires less time than the native as-measured sequences, suggesting a superposition of low frequency chaotic fluctuations and high frequency behaviors (which may be produced by more than one possible source of entropy). Using an array of nonlinear time-series analyses for dynamical systems, i.e., the computation of largest Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions, and re-construction of phase portraits, we found that low-pass filtered datasets undergo a transition from quasi-periodic to chaotic to quasi-hyper-chaotic behavior, and back again to chaos when the voltage controlling-parameter is increased. The high frequency part of the signals is discussed in terms of highly nonlinear turbulent motion developed around the working electrode. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB  - This study develops a triple-hysteresis energy management strategy for off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems that combine wind and solar generation with lithium-ion battery storage and a multi-technology hydrogen subsystem (alkaline and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, hydrogen storage, and a fuel cell). The strategy coordinates startup/shutdown behavior, power allocation, and capacity configuration while explicitly accounting for component degradation and cycling stress. It applies distinct hysteresis bands to the battery, electrolyzers, and fuel cell to limit unnecessary switching and stabilize long-term operation. System performance is evaluated over both a 1-year optimization horizon and a 20-year lifecycle. The proposed strategy jointly reduces the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and the wind-solar curtailment to load energy ratio (WSCLR). It also lowers dependence on fast-response components: the energy shares handled by the PEMEL and the battery decrease from 23.0 % to 14.5 %-17.7 % and 10.7 %, respectively. Over 20 years, the strategy achieves reductions of 2.7 % in LCOE, 79.1 % in LPSP, and 45.0 % in WSCLR, while reducing power fluctuations, limiting start-stop frequency, and improving operational robustness. These results indicate that the proposed control approach can enhance both the economic viability and reliability of off-grid hydrogen-electric microgrids.

AB  - Hand-drawn batik wastewater has the specific characteristics of intense color, alkaline pH, low COD and BOD contents ( +/- 800 and +/- 500 mg/L, respectively), and may pose environmental and human health risks. Chemicals used in dyeing and dewaxing processes (i.e., dye, wax, alum sulfate and starch) will influence chemical characteristics of wastewater generated. The integration of bioequalization and electrocatalytic was attempted in the present study as a feasible technology to treat these pollutants. Bioequalization tank of 18 m(3) was inoculated with 10% (v/v) seed sludge, equipped with four uniformly distributed feeding pipes and subsequently connected to an electrocatalytic reactor of 1.2 m(3) capacity. Ti/RuIrO2 anode and stainless-steel cathode were used in the system with an electrode gap of 30 mm. The effluent was able to meet the discharge standard of local regulation at HRT of 48 h in bioequalization and electrolysis operating conditions: 5 V potential, pH 5, 4000 mg L-1 salt concentration and electrolysis time of 90 min. The electrode materials were potentially deactivated due to surface enclosure and metal decomposition, particularly ruthenium.

AB  - H2O2 is one of the most major active species generated in discharge plasma process. A multi-channel pulsed discharge plasma system was developed to investigate H2O2 formation characteristics during p-nitrophenol (PNP) contaminated soil remediation. Effects of gas varieties (air, O-2, Ar and N-2), air flow rate, and species scavengers on H2O2 formation were evaluated, and PNP degradation performance was also evaluated under various species scavengers. The experimental results revealed that the highest H2O2 concentration was obtained in O-2 plasma atmosphere, and followed in descends by air, Ar and N-2 atmospheres; and H2O2 formation rates in the case of O-2, air, Ar and N-2 were 2.9 x 10(-7), 1.8 x 1.2 x 10(-7) and 8.9 x 10(-8) mol L-1 S-1 under the condition of peak pulse discharge voltage of 27.0 kV and gas flow rate of 0.8 L min(-1), respectively. Increasing air flow rate to a certain extent was beneficial for H2O2 formation. The addition of n-butanol or H2PO4- into soil sample displayed negative effects on H2O2 formation, while the addition of HCO3- promoted H2O2 formation. Direct attack of high energy electrons to water molecules was the main pathway for H2O2 formation during direct pulse discharge plasma in soil; electrolysis reaction route of dissolved O-2 would take place to generate H2O2 and ozone decomposition in alkaline soil also played significant roles in H2O2 formation; however, the recombination of (OH)-O-center dot radicals exhibited relatively low contribution to H2O2 formation. PNP degradation efficiency decreased by 12.7%, 19.0% and 30.4% within 45 min's discharge plasma treatment at 27 kV with n-butanol, HCO3- and H2PO4- addition, respectively, which further confirmed the roles of high energy electrons and (OH)-O-center dot radicals in H2O2 formation.

AB  - Electrochemical nitrogen reduction to produce ammonia beyond overall two-electrode electrolysis with less energy input is necessary but challenging. Herein, hollow cobalt phosphate microspheres (CoPi/HSNPC) derived from corresponding cobalt phosphonates are employed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward both nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Benefiting from the sufficient active sites and the enhanced proton-conducting pathways, the CoPi/HSNPC exhibits a high NH3 yield rate of 16.48 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) with a faradaic efficiency of 4.46% at -0.2 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, associated with excellent stability for cycling operation. The Co2+ sites of cobalt phosphate microspheres are revealed as the active component for the NRR through the associative pathway, and the phosphate groups are also beneficial for the enhanced NRR activity. The CoPi/HSNPC also exhibits extraordinary OER activity with an overpotential of 341 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) of anodic current density and a negligible current decay during 30 h. When employed as the cathode catalyst of a rechargeable Zn-N-2 battery, a large NH3 yield rate of 11.62 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and faradaic efficiency of 24.42% with decreased charge-discharge potential gaps as well as an impressive power output including a peak power density of 0.31 mW cm(-2) and an energy density of 138.6 mW h g(zn)(-1) are achieved, providing an attractive perspective for practical applications. Moreover, the assembled Zn-N-2 battery can maintain robust cycling operation with a stable NH3 yield rate driven by the sustainable electricity input from solar energy.

AB  - Mathematical modeling is an important part of the modern approach to solving applied problems. It enables reduction of both time and economical resources by cutting down the number of full-scale studies. To solve practical problems, mathematical model complexes that describe physical processes at different levels are often used. Additionally, more "simple" models make it possible to tease out the processes needing to be accounted for and provide primary information about them. Thus, this work describes the application of modification of the direct Hooke-Jeeves method to solving the problem of predicting the current yield of hydrogen during the electrolysis of an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide. Interest in hydrogen production through the improvement of electrolyzer models has enjoyed a new lease on life due to the increased need for alternative energy sources. The solution of this problem is based on minimizing the sum of squared deviations of the predicted values from the available experimental data. The optimization parameters are the rates of the cathode stepwise reaction constants. The set of kinetic reactions simulating the yield is solved by the Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. In contrast to the Faraday Law, widely used for yield estimation, this algorithm makes it possible to determine the concentration and calculate the rate of constants of stepwise near-electrode reactions for all particles that react at a particular electrode. The obtained algorithm can be generalized to predict the yield of deposited material in electroplating and discharges with liquid electrodes, and the obtained rate constants can be used in setting the boundary conditions for spatial models.

AB  - The extreme pH, high color, and poor biodegradability of refractory wastewater have severe impacts on its biological treatment. To address this issue, an advanced Fe-Cu process with redox reaction and spontaneous coagulation was investigated and applied for pilot-scale (wastewater flow rate of 2000 m(3)center dot day(-1)) pretreatment of separately discharged acidic chemicals and alkaline dyeing wastewater. The advanced Fe-Cu process had five functions: (1) increasing the pH of chemical wastewater to 5.0 and above, with an influent pH of approximately 2.0; (2) transforming refractory organics of chemical wastewater with 10.0% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 30.8% color removal, thereby enhancing the ratio of biological oxygen demand after five days (BOD5) to COD (B/C) from 0.21 to 0.38; (3) neutralizing the pH of the pretreated chemical wastewater for coagulation application with alkaline dyeing wastewater to avoid adding alkaline chemical; (4) achieving average nascent Fe (II) concentrations of 925.6 mg center dot L (1) using Fe-Cu internal electrolysis for mixed wastewater coagulation, resulting in an average of 70.3% color removal and 49.5% COD removal; (5) providing more efficient COD removal and B/ C enhancement than FeSO4 center dot 7 H2O coagulation while avoiding secondary pollution.

AB  - A theoretical analysis is provided to describe the recently proposed 'convection battery', wherein electrolyte flow is driven through a battery cell to alter its efficiency and power. Concentrated-solution theory rationalizes the observation that imposition of electrolyte flow parallel to the current through a separator can reduce overpotential losses. Equations are provided that allow this overpotential reduction to be computed in terms of the flow rate, as well as physical properties of the electrolyte and separator. Model results are consistent with earlier experimental observations of alkaline convection batteries. Current-coaxial flows with relatively low rates are found to allow fine-tuned control over limiting currents. Driving electrolyte flow through traditional rechargeable battery cells could facilitate very high charge rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A reversible Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple of an azamacrocyclic complex is evaluated as an electrolyte with a pH-tunable potential range for aqueous redox-flow batteries (RFBs). The Fe-III complex is formed by 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) appended with three 2-methyl-imidazole donors, denoted as Fe(Tim). This complex exhibits pH-sensitive redox couples that span E-1/2(Fe3+/Fe2+)=317 to -270 mV vs. NHE at pH3.3 and pH12.8, respectively. The 590 mV shift in potential and kinetic inertness are driven by ionization of the imidazoles at various pH values. The Fe3+/Fe2+ redox is proton-coupled at alkaline conditions, and bulk electrolysis is non-destructive. The electrolyte demonstrates high charge/discharge capacities at both acidic and alkaline conditions throughout 100 cycles. Given its tunable redox, fast electrochemical kinetics, exceptional stability/cyclability, this complex is promising for the design of aqueous RFB catholytes and anolytes that utilize the earth-abundant element iron.

AB  - Particle-like Co3O4-CeO2 nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile thermal decomposition process in the presence of fructose as a green capping agent and ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate as Ce source. The effect of various parameters such as different cobalt sources, calcination temperature and time were investigated on the size and morphology of products. The transmission electron microscopy observations indicated that the synthesized products have a particle-like shape with an average diameter of 18-35 nm. For the first time, the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of Co3O4-CeO2 porous nanocomposite was investigated via chronopotentiometry method in aqueous KOH solution in this paper. The electrochemical measurements showed that this product has a good hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature. Its maximum discharge capacity was 5200 mAh/g after 20 cycles. Therefore, Co3O4-CeO2 porous nanocomposite showed that it is a good candidate for electrochemical hydrogen storage. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A simple and promising route to prepare ruthenium carbon (Ru/C) composites by co-electroreduction with RuCl3 center dot nH2O and CO2 in mixed LiCl-KCl-CaO salt is proposed. Ru/C composites with curled and lamellar nano-microstructure of Ru loaded on the carbon are successfully electro-deposited at 550 degrees C, voltage cell of 3.0 V, electrolysis for 6 h from RuCl3 center dot nH2O and CO2. Ru ions are electro-reduced to metallic Ru via three electrons transfer behavior, and CO2 is captured and transformed into carbon through a two-step and four electrons process. Ru with 15.86 wt% is loaded on the carbon in the synchronous co-electrodeposition reaction. The ions diffusion of Ru ions are the limiting step. The diffusion coefficient is 8.3296 x 10-5 cm-2 s-1. In 6.0 M KOH solution, Ru/C composites with 405.8 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 in charge-discharge curves as supercapacitor's electrode materials shows great storage energy performance. The capacitance retention rate at 10 A g-1 after 5000 charge-discharge cycles is close to 100 %. The maximum capacitance is 202 F g-1 at 20 mV s-1. The specific capacitance retention at 200 mV s-1 is still 93.8 % after 5000 cycles. This paper gives a new perspective to prepared Ru/C composites electrode materials for good pseudo-capacitance performance.

AB  - Air-breathing reversible microfluidic fuel cell (RMFC) provides flexibility to choose either acid or alkaline medium for the bifunctional oxygen electrode. A numerical model has been developed and validated to predict the performance of an air-breathing RMFC. Half-cell J-V characteristics of the RMFC using different pH media for the oxygen electrode are compared. The model results suggest that when the RMFC is operated in fuel cell (FC) mode, alkaline medium is preferred for the oxygen electrode, and when operated in electrolysis-cell (EC) mode, acid medium is preferred. By further analyzing the round-trip energy efficiency and major potential loss of the half-cell, it is found that adopting acid medium for oxygen electrode can maximize the overall charging/discharging cycle efficiency and performance of RMFC, due to much lower activation overpotential in the EC mode. Heat and mass transport characteristics of the half-cell are also investigated. It is found that the flowing electrolyte can efficiently remove the heat generated by various sources in the RMFC, leading to the mass convection in the oxygen electrode and surrounding environment solely driven by concentration gradient. Due to the presence of water vapor as the reaction product, FC mode operation in acid medium yields the most intensive breathing process of the oxygen electrode. The results provide implications to further optimizations of RMFC. Copyright (c) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concentrated brine from seawater desalination plants is generally discharged directly to the sea. To reuse brine, diaphragm type chlor-alkali experiments were carried out to make alkaline solution and gases. For this purpose, a rectangular acrylic reactor, 66.5 g/L of sodium chloride solution, a PTFE hydrophilic filter as asbestos free diaphragm, and IrO2 coated titanium net or plate electrode were used. The experimental results show that sodium hydroxide concentration and chloride removal increased with higher current density, and had inverse linear correlations to the increasing flow rate. The theoretical maximum sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent was estimated as 4.06%. Chloride removal and electric conductivity have a linear correlation with the sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent. Hydroxyl ion production was affected by the surface area of electrode per unit volume and by diaphragm pore size. Back-migration of hydroxyl ions from the cathode to anode is the major reason for side-reactions that cause low faradaic efficiency, including oxygen production in the anode compartment. Over 99% pure hydrogen was produced in the cathode compartment, and the current efficiency of hydrogen production was calculated as 92 - 99%.

AB  - Electrosynthesis via electrochemical plasma, a discharge over the surface of liquid water (or plasma cathode), may offer an unprecedented route of synthesis for chemicals and (wind) solar fuels. Describing the physical chemical events underneath plasma/liquid interface (PLI) on a theoretical basis is crucial for enabling a rational designing of chemical synthesis. To address this problem, this work proposes a generalist dynamical model for the nanoreactor, a fraction of nanoliters localized beneath the PLI that features substantially high concentration of hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)), and it screens chemical reaction networks (CRN) related to the synthesis of hydrogen, a model electrosynthesis process. The computational results elucidate two major routes for hydrogen production: (a) in very alkaline media, the water reduction via self-recombination of eaq- [2e(aq)(-) + 2H(2)O -> H-2 + 2OH(-)] consumes the majority of e(aq)(-), whereas (b) in very acid media, e(aq)(-) is majorly scavenger by the ion H-aq(+), generating an abnormally high concentration of the radical H center dot<bold>,</bold>a precursor for gaseous hydrogen. Additionally, two scenarios are disadvantageous for synthesizing H-2. Side reactions with aqueous oxygen and aqueous radical center dot OH leads to substantial production of O-2(-) and OH-, respectively. Without loss of generality, the dynamical model proposed in this work is a powerful theoretical frame for understanding and predicting a variety of plasma-induced CRNs, assisting to advance the emerging field of plasma electrochemistry.

AB  - The current demand for drinking water is rapidly exceeding the water supply. Desalination is one effective way to solve the worldwide water shortage. However, disposal of concentrated brine depends on discharge through oceans and evaporation ponds. Electrolysis is one of the solutions to address discharge of concentrated brine. Electrolysis is mainly categorized into mercury, diaphragm, and membrane types. Diaphragm type electrolysis was adopted here and was applied to a 200 mL reactor. A 10 mu m pore size filter was used, and the head was <8 cm. The data in this study were collected to evaluate NaOH concentration, Cl- removal, and current efficiency (CE) by changing the concentrated degree and electrode material. When changing the concentrated brine to degrees of raw, triple, and quintuple, NaOH concentration was 1.6%, 2.3%, and 2.8% and Cl- removal was 75%, 39%, and 28%, respectively. These tendencies were caused by decreasing internal resistance. CE was inversely proportional to temperature, caused by ion quantity. Because iridium has a lower electrical resistivity than ruthenium, electrical resistivity has a decisive effect on electricity consumption. When highly concentrated brine was used in electrolysis, around 3% NaOH alkaline water was produced. Because of the thermal resistance of reactor in acrylic, the maximum temperature of operating reactor was until 90 degrees C. Current density can be higher in the reactor if brine concentration is higher. The right options for catalyst material selection depend on the designated purpose of the catalyst material.

AB  - We improved the design of an ion membrane electrolysis device to assess its use for electrolytic desalination and hydrogen production utilizing wastewater discharged from a subsurface drainage pipe in saline-alkali land. The device can reduce the waste of water resources and agricultural non-point source pollution. The electrolysis performance is low due to the low concentration of salts and complex ionic species in the drainage water from subsurface pipes of farmland. A one-factor quantitative experimental study was conducted to assess the influence of the electrolysis parameters on the electrolytic characteristics. Multifactor synergistic optimization of the parameters was performed. The results indicate different degrees of linear correlations between the hydrogen and chlorine gas production rates and the current density (CD) for different process parameters. Different factors have different degrees of influence on the electrolysis characteristics, and factor interactions occur. The optimization model describing the effects of multiple factors on the final current density (FCD), pH value after reaction (ARP), and energy consumption rate (ECR) is reliable and stable. The optimized operating parameters included a brine concentration (BC) of 3.6 mol.L-1, before reaction pH (BRP) value of 9, working voltage (WV) of 12.2 V, and electrode immersion depth (EID) of 22.5 cm. Under these conditions, the FCD is 183.03 mA.cm(-2), the ARP is 13.99, and the ECR is 24,586.50 kW.h/kg. The proposed method substantially improves the electrolysis performance. The results provide theoretical and technical support for utilizing saline wastewater discharged from saline-alkaline land.

AB  - To achieve global emission reduction targets, the production of "green hydrogen" using renewable energy sources (RES) is increasingly recognized as a promising solution. However, integrating the hydrogen production system adds complexity and raises stability concerns for off-grid solar hydrogen production. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel decentralized control scheme to enhance system stability. In this scheme, hydrogen acts as an energy buffer, enabling it to adapt to fluctuations in RES without the need for communication, thus preventing the frequent charging and discharging of the battery energy storage system (BESS). The system's impedance model is established using the small-signal linearization method to analyze the stabilization and destabilization mechanisms resulting from the interactions among photovoltaic (PV) modules, the electrolyzer, and the BESS. Additionally, MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results show that the stability margin of the proposed method is improved by 63.16% compared to alternative approaches.

AB  - A new technology of neutralization flow batteries was recently proposed as a promising alternative to conven-tional redox flow batteries due to the low cost of employed electrolytes - acid and base solutions. Despite the advantages of this concept, their performance metrics are still quite modest for industrial applications. To fulfill this gap, in previous work, the authors presented a new two-membrane neutralization flow battery that is meant to overcome issues of reverse electrodialysis cells with bipolar membrane. This concept demonstrates promising results, but the battery discharge performance was limited by alkaline anode where the hydrogen oxidation reaction occurs. In this study we offer the approach to advance the battery performance by implementation of gas diffusion electrodes with gas-fed supply mode. The aforementioned modification allows us to achieve record power (40-87 mW cm-2) and energy (8-48 Wh L-1) densities along with a significant enhancement of the cycling performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The electrochemical recovery of copper and chelating agent from their complex solution using a membrane flow cell was investigated. The parameters electrolysis time, solution pH, current density, and temperature were investigated.
   RESULTS: Electrochemical investigation indicated that chelating ligands can be recovered by the electrodeposition of copper ions on the cathode. For copper and EDTA recovery, the results indicated that recovery efficiency was affected by time, current density, and temperature. The recovery process was not influenced by pH in the range studied (pH 8-12), which can be explained by the low variation in the conditional stability constant, i.e. Delta log(10) K' <= 0.7, over the pH range. However, when NTA, EDTA, and DTPA were compared, the results indicated that the recovery efficiency decreased as the conditional stability constant of the chelating agent-Cu(II) complex increased. The maximum current efficiency of copper and EDTA recovery after 5 h of treatment was approximately 85%, whereas the recovery was 80% of the initial concentration (0.05 mol L-1) at a current density of 1 A dm(-2), temperature of 333 K, and pH of 10.
   CONCLUSION: Relatively high recovery efficiency makes the process fairly sustainable and hinders the discharge of copper ions and chelating ligands as pollutants into the environment. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - This study presents a system to electro-neutralize agrochemicals in food and water samples based on the properties of a controlled electron trap, the related apparatus is protected under patent application (WO/2018/090110; INPI: BR 10 2016 0268486) / (PCT / BR 2017/050115). The efficacy of the system was verified as to the type, quantity, surface tension charge, temperature, pH and static energy loading of the electrolyte for both solid and liquid samples. It also took into consideration the retention and accumulation measurement of electric charges, verification of electrical potential differences and also accumulation by applying pulsed high voltage in according to the Daniell Cell method. The proposed technology is able to provide the electron-neutralization of acidic and alkaline chemicals and their toxic byproducts by modifying the pH of the liquid or solid medium. This is justified by the action of the electron trap using different polarities and electrodes in the range of 8 to 100 kV.

AB  - The low-cost production of high-purity metallic iron is of great practical importance. Herein, we report the direct production of high-purity metallic iron (99.92%) via a one-step electrochemical strategy in molten CaCl2-CaO-Fe2O3 system at 850 degrees C. The involved CaO-assisted dissolution of Fe2O3 and electrodeposition mechanism were systematically studied, and the obtained iron products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, inductively-coupled high-frequency plasma emission spectrometry, and glow discharge mass spectrometry. The results show that the crystalline iron products with tunable morphologies can be obtained in a controlled manner. The electrolysis parameters (voltage, current density, electrodeposition time and substrate material) have significant effects on the electrodeposition process and the characteristics of iron products. In particular, high-purity dense iron film can be directly electrodeposited at 15 mA.cm(-2), and its thickness increases considerably with increasing electrodeposition time. Furthermore, the as-deposited iron product can also be processed into bulk iron materials with high-purity of 99.995 wt.% by plasma melting for the potential applications. In general, this one-step electrodeposition process provides an acid-/alkaline-free strategy for the facile production of high-purity iron materials direct from Fe2O3.

AB  - Through a facile solvothermal procedure, a CdS/WOx nanocomposite has been synthesised which exhibits photocapacitive behaviour under white light illumination at a radiant flux density of 99.3 mW cm(-2). Photoelectrochemical experiments were undertaken to examine the self-charging properties of the material and to develop an understanding of the underlying electronic band structure responsible for the phenomenon. By employing XPS, UPS and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for further characterisation, the ability of the composite to generate current following the removal of incident light was related to the trapping of photoexcited electrons by the WOx component. The presence of WOx yielded an order of magnitude increase in the transient photocurrent response relative to CdS alone, an effect attributed to the suppression of electron-hole recombination in CdS due to hole transfer across the CdS/WOx interface. Moreover, current discharge from the material persisted for more than twenty minutes after final illumination, an order of magnitude improvement over many existing binary composites. As a seminal investigation into the photocapacitive characteristics of CdS/WOx composites, the work offers insight into how the constituent materials might be utilised as part of a future self-charging solar device.

AB  - The development of high-performance and stable trifunctional electrocatalysts is a pressing challenge for the practical application of water splitting and regenerative Zn-air batteries. Herein, bamboo-like N-doped carbon tubes encapsulated Co2P-Fe2P nano-particles (CoFe-PN/C) was fabricated via a facile template-sacrificial approach by using CoZn-ZIF trapping Fe3+ (CoFeZn/C) as the precursor. The incorporation of Fe3+ was achieved by the one-pot synthesis approach during crystallization of ZIF, which led to the generation of the unique bamboo-like tube structure under the condition of simultaneous phosphating and carbonization. Benefiting from the large surface area, the optimized electronic structure of active sites and the unique bamboo-like nanotube, the resultant CoFe-PN/C can be used as the trifunctional electrocatalyst possessing a small overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 for the HER (178 mV) and OER (300 mV), as well as a high half-wave potential of 0.884 V for ORR (40 mV more positive than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C). Moreover, the self-designed CoFe-PN/C||CoFe-PN/C alkaline electrolyzer driving 50 mA cm-2 only need operating potential of 1.84 V and the maximum discharge power density of the CoFePN/C-assembled ZABs could achieve 152.0 mW cm-2, superior to those of Pt/RuO2 couple. This work will facilitate the development and application of trifunctional electrocatalysts based on bi-transition metallic phosphides for energy conversion and storage technology. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - In this study, experimental reactors for cathodic nitrogen plasma electrolysis were designed by the composition of galvanic (voltaic) and electrolytic cells with wide and narrow connectors filled with tap water and agar solutions. The designed reactor can be used to simultaneously perform and manage nitrification in acidic and alkaline environments. According to the reactor's performance, it can be installed on the irrigation system and used depending on the soil pH of the fields for delivering water and nitrogen species that are effective in growth. The nitrification process was investigated by choosing the optimal reactor with a wide connector based on different changes in oxidation-reduction potential and pH on the anode and cathode sides. The nitrite concentration changed directly with ammonium and nitrate concentrations on the cathode side. It changed inversely and directly with ammonium and nitrate concentrations on the anode side respectively. Nitrite concentration decreased from 5.387 ppm with water connector, to 0.326 ppm with 20% agar solution, and 0.314 ppm with 30% agar solution connectors on the anode side. It increased from 0 ppm to 0.191 ppm with a water connector, 0.405 ppm with 20% agar solution, and 7.454 ppm with 30% agar solution connectors on the cathode side.

AB  - Copper, as an inseparable part of many industrial discharges, threatens both public and environmental health. In this work, an electrochemical cell utilizing a cellulosic separator was used to evaluate Cu removal using graphite anodes and stainless steel cathodes in a continuous-flow mode reactor. In the experimental matrix, Cu concentration (1-5 mg L-1), electrolysis time (20-90 min), and current intensity (0.1-0.4 A) were employed. Results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of copper was obtained as 99%. The removal efficiency was independent of initial copper concentration and directly related to electrolysis time and current intensity. Energy consumption was more dependent on current intensity than electrolysis time. Under optimal conditions (75.8 min electrolysis time, 0.18 A current intensity, and 3 mg L-1 copper concentration), the removal efficiency was obtained as 91% while 7.05 kWh m(-3) electrical energy was consumed. The differences between the actual and predicted data under optimal conditions were 0.42% for copper removal and 0.23% for energy consumption, which signify the performance and reliability of the developed models. The results exhibited the suitability of the electrochemical reduction for copper removal from aqueous solutions, which was facilitated under alkaline conditions prevailing in the cathodic compartment due to applying a cell divided by a cellulosic separator.

AB  - Actual high saline wastewater containing concentrated organics and sodium chloride is a bioenergy and renewable resource. This study compared two different bipolar membrane electrodialysis membranes from two companies' stacks to recover HCl and NaOH from sodium chloride solution and actual chemical wastewater. The results demonstrated that the electrolysis rates were around 1.5 kg/m(2)h, the HCl and NaOH production rates were about 0.9 kg/m(2)h, energy consumption was in the range of 1.05-1.27 kWh/kg, and the economic benefits were above 1 yuan/h in BMED systems. From analyzing the performance of seven different BMED membrane stacks, the B2 stack was chosen for electrolyzing actual high salt wastewater to observe the effect of chemical oxygen demand on BMED systems, where electrolytic salt performance, HCl-NaOH alkali production rates, and energy consumption show linear dependence on time for 5000 mg/L chemical oxygen demand wastewater. It illustrated chemical oxygen demand can enhance energy consumption and reduce electrolytic salt performance and the acid and alkali production rates, due to improving the membrane area resistance. In this study, the effect of high COD saline wastewater on the performance of a BMED membrane stack was clarified and the mechanism was analyzed for its practical application in treating chemical high salt wastewater.

AB  - Whether CuO reduction is one step or two steps reaction has been argued for several decades, and one step reaction mechanism is mainly supported by CuO CV (cyclic voltammetry) profile, where only one cathodic peak represents the direct reduction from CuO to Cu. However, some researchers support two steps reaction mechanism, because they observed Cu2O as intermediate with spectroscopy technique or two cathodic peaks in the CV profile. In this study, two colloid electrodes containing crystal CuO particles are electrolyzed in KCl electrolyte at -1.7 V and -1.65 V respectively, and both of the products are composed of Cu2O and Cu. The electrolysis voltage can change the weight ratio of Cu2O and Cu, and the electrolysis results firmly prove that CuO reduction is two steps reaction: CuO is reduced to Cu2O, then to Cu. Therefore, the rationality of the criterion for determining one step reaction is re-considered in this study. The experimental conditions and parameters, including CV scan rate, atom arrangement of CuO, particle size of CuO, and anions and pH value of electrolyte, are discussed in the present study, and all these factors can affect CuO reduction process, thus influencing the cathotic peaks, such as the number, shape and potential of the peaks in CuO CV profile. It could lead to incorrect conclusion, when CuO reduction steps is determined by the cathode peak without comprehensive consideration of the effect from all these factors. In another word, cathodic peak number in the CV profile sometimes is not a straightforward and appropriate criterion to determine the number of steps of CuO reduction. In addition, S2- ions is found to be an effective addtive to enhance the cyclic ability and discharge plateau of Cu alkaline battery in this study. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - High-penetration renewable energy grid integration in electric vehicle charging stations and hydrogen refueling stations often faces challenges such as significant energy fluctuations, energy wastage, and system instability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Dynamic Hysteresis Energy Management strategy (DHEM). This strategy incorporates hysteresis theory and adjusts the charge-discharge strategy of the energy storage system by setting thresholds for the State of Charge (SOC) of lithium-ion batteries, namely SOCgrid, SOCelzoff, and SOCelzon. Additionally, a price difference evaluation mechanism is designed for dynamic electricity pricing, optimizing the operation of electrolyzers and batteries, and balancing energy storage and consumption. Multiobjective optimization is subsequently performed using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, focusing on the evaluation of levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and renewable energy wastage. Sensitivity analysis determines the optimal configurations for SOCgrid, SOCelzoff, and SOCelzon within the DHEM. The results demonstrate that compared to traditional and hysteresis-based strategies, the DHEM reduces LCOE by 17% and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, the single-start-stop operation times of Alkaline Electrolyzer and Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer increase by 48% and 12%, and 109% and 14%, respectively. In typical daily operations, DHEM improves system efficiency and stability by optimizing energy storage and power purchase decisions. Additionally, DHEM achieves a balance in cost, environmental, and social benefits, contributing to the sustainable development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

AB  - Molten carbonate fuel cells have been under development for a number of years and reliable units are successfully working at 250kW scale and demonstration units have produced up to 2 MW. Although these cells cannot be considered as renewable as the fuel, hydrogen or carbon monoxide is consumed and not regenerated, the excellent reliability of such a cell can act as a stimulus to innovative development of similar cells with different outcomes. Molten salt electrolytes based upon LiCl - Li2O can be used to convert carbon dioxide, either drawn from the output of a conventional thermal power station or from the atmosphere, to carbon monoxide or carbon. Recently, dimensionally stable anodes have been developed for molten salt electrolytes, based upon alkali or alkaline ruthenates which are highly electronically conducting and these may allow the concept of high temperature batteries to be developed in which an alkali or alkaline earth element reacts with air to form oxides when the battery is discharging and the oxide decomposes when the battery is being recharged. Batteries using these concepts may be based upon the Hall-Heroult cell, which is used worldwide for the production of aluminium on an industrial scale, and could be used for load levelling. Lithium ion batteries are, at present, the preferred energy source for cars in 2050 as there are sufficient lithium reserves to satisfy the world's energy needs for this particular application. Graphite is used in lithium ion batteries as the anode but the capacity is relatively low. Silicon and tin have much higher capacities and the use of these materials, encapsulated in carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles will be described. This paper will review these interesting developments and demonstrate that a combination of carbon and molten salts can offer novel ways of storing energy and converting carbon dioxide into useful products.

AB  - Flexibility is becoming highly important for the power grid as the renewable energy contribute towards a higher proportion. As basic power source, nuclear power plants (NPPs) are also expected to improve flexibility capability to facilitate the high penetration of the renewable energy. The present work provides a novel path combined solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) and H2-O2 burning to improve the flexibility capacity for nuclear power and realize the coupling supply of H2, O2 and hot water. The flexibility performance of NPPs-SOECs system is estimated based on a self-established thermal model. Within the SOECs temperature ranges of 600 degrees C-1000 degrees C, a lowest unit load of 20.4 % with a minimum unit electrical consumption of 3.08 kWh/Nm3 for hydrogen production can be achieved during charge period. In discharge period, a highest unit load of 113.3 % can be achieved based on H2-O2 burning. The cycle efficiency of NPPs-SOECs can reach 56.5 % in this simulation. When NPPs are coupled for H2 production, SOECs have the highest energy utilization efficiency of 40.5 %, significantly higher than that of alkaline electrolysis and proton exchange membrane.

AB  - Background: Tritium monitoring in seawater has become increasingly important for environmental safety assessment, particularly following Japan's radioactive wastewater discharge. However, extremely low tritium concentrations in Korean coastal waters (0.09-0.45 Bq center dot L-1) are below detection limits of conventional liquid scintillation counting methods. While alkaline electrolysis can concentrate tritium, it requires about 20 days processing time, making it unsuitable for rapid environmental monitoring. Conventional spike-proxy methods for determining initial concentrations assume identical conditions across multiple samples, leading to potential analytical errors. There is an urgent need for rapid tritium enrichment technology with accurate concentration determination methods for environmental monitoring. Results: A Tritium PEM electrolytic enrichment multiprocessor system was developed, capable of processing four samples simultaneously using commercial stacks with Ru0.55Ir0.45O2 mixed anode catalysts. The system incorporated automated controls including infrared sensors, pumps, and cooling systems to minimize operator intervention and ensure reproducible results. Optimal operating conditions were determined through systematic evaluation of ion exchange resin quantity, anode catalyst type, cell configuration, and cooling temperature. Tritium residual ratio curves (TRRC) were derived as individual stack characteristics to account for tritium loss during electrolysis, enabling more accurate initial concentration determination than conventional methods. Validation using standard solutions at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-10 Bq center dot L- 1) showed relative standard deviations below 8.5 %. Natural seawater analysis demonstrated tritium concentrations of 0.27 +/- 0.09 Bq center dot L-1 with enrichment factors exceeding 22-fold and processing times of 94 h. Interlaboratory comparison with ASNR yielded satisfactory results (c-score = 0.4), confirming method reliability. Significance: The PEM-based system achieved 1.5-fold higher enrichment factors and an 80 % reduction in percell processing time (from 20 to 4 days) compared to alkaline electrolysis, while maintaining comparable throughput. The tritium residual ratio curve approach significantly improved analytical accuracy for unknown samples. This system enhances enables faster response times and more frequent sampling for marine environmental monitoring.

AB  - Nowadays, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have attracted significant attention due to their high efficiency in removing recalcitrant compounds from wastewater. The electrochemical peroxidation (ECP) process allows to avoid the use of chemicals that could increase the salinity of the effluent. However, research has been limited to laboratory-scale systems in recent years, while little efforts have been made to adapt these technologies in industrial applications. In this study, for the first time, a continuous serpentine plug-flow electrochemical reactor was tested as tertiary treatment in tannery wastewater using the ECP process under alkaline conditions, according to the optimal operating conditions found in our previous work. The results highlighted high removal efficiencies for COD (68.6 %), TOC (64 %), and color (84.5 %), meeting the required standards for discharge. Conversely, chlorides, sulphates, and total nitrogen were hardly removed, while the concentration of ammonium and iron in the solution increased with the electrolysis time. XRD and SEM-EDS analysis confirmed that the produced sludge was primarily composed of Fe3O4 and CaCO3, thus enabling recycling options. According to the energy consumption (0.044 kWh/g of COD removed), future efforts need to investigate technological advances and required total costs, in order to improve the environmental ed economic feasibility of the process for industrial applications.

AB  - Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been studied for preparing flexible and compact electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the preparation and use of GPEs are complex, and most GPEs prepared through traditional methods do not have good wettability with the electrodes, which retard them from achieving their performance potential. In this study, these problems are addressed by conceiving and implementing a simple, but effective, method of electrodepositing poly(vinyl alcohol) potassium borate (PVAPB) GPEs directly onto the surfaces of active carbon electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. PVAPB GPEs serve as both the electrolyte and the separator in the assembled supercapacitors,, and their scale and shape are determined solely by the geometry of the electrodes. PVAPB GPEs have good bonding to the active electrode materials, leading to excellent and stable electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance of PVAPB GPEs and supercapacitors can be manipulated simply by adjusting, the concentration of KCl salt used during the electrodeposition process. With a 0.9 M KCl concentration, the as-prepared supercapacitors deliver a specific capacitance of 65.9 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and retain more than 95% capacitance after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1). These supercapacitors also exhibit intelligent high voltage self-protection function due to the electrolysis-induced cross-linking effect of PVAPB GPEs.

AB  - A novel and sensitive detection system was introduced based on amperometry inside flame for rapid determination of total alkali ions in the human cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) at nM levels. For this purpose, a triangular (Y-shaped) three-electrode system included two stainless steel rods as well as a brass disk as working, counter and pseudo reference electrodes inside H-2/air flame. In the fabricated system, mixture of H-2 and air was introduced to the flame through a capillary hole along the working electrode. The analyte was introduced to the flame as electrolyte through the formation of aerosols using a sonicator and N-2 as carrier gas. The inter-electrode distance was set to 2.0 mm. Based on one at a time method, the optimum flow rates of H-2, air and N-2 were 375, 259 and 2.6 mL min(-1), respectively. Solution of HCl (0.45 M) was also selected as supporting electrolyte. Maximum sensitivity (peak current) was observed at DC potential of -36.0 +/- 1.0V (vs. the pseudo reference electrode). According to the figures of merit under the optimized condition, this system had linear dynamic ranges between 250-12000 ng mL(-1) for Li+, 180-11400 ng mL(-1) for Na+, 200-12000 ng mL(-1) for K+ and 110-6400 ng mL(-1) for Cs+. Relative standard deviation (RSD) for 8 replicate analyses of Na+ as selected model was similar to 7.0%. Based on 90% of maximum response (t90), the response time was estimated to be 3.0 s. No interference was observed, when introducing at least 1000-fold excess of foreign species such as Ag+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, NH4+, acetone, ethanol, CH3COO(-), NO3(-), Cl-, oxalate, SO4(-2), tartrate, and PO4(-3). However similar to 20% positive error was observed during introduction of similar to 500-fold excess of some alkaline earth metal cations such as Ba2+ and Ca2+. The validity of this method was evaluated via analyses of different water samples. The reliability and application of this method was finally evaluated via determination of total alkali ions in different CSFs. Good correlation was observed between the total concentrations of alkali ions and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in various patients. This method was therefore applicable for discrimination and prediction of AD via analyses of alkali species in the CSFs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Button battery incidents have become a rising medical issue in recent years, especially for infants. The increasing number of these cases can be explained by the expanding use of objects of everyday life and toys. As a result, button batteries in many households are ubiquitous in different states of charge. The extremely long shelf-life and the increasing energy densities of lithium button batteries boost the potential medical complications of accidental swallowing.
   Objective: The study aimed to analyze the pathophysiology of damage to tracheobronchial structures by button batteries aspiration over time.
   Methods: CR2032 and CR927 lithium button batteries (3.2/3.0 V) were exposed to porcine trachea preparations intraluminal at 37 degrees C in intervals up to 36 h. Measurements were made of the voltage curve, the discharge current, and the resulting pH values around the electrodes. The effects on tissue were examined using macroscopic time-lapse images and microscopic pictures of sections of the fixed specimens over time.
   Findings: The examinations showed a tissue electrolysis reaction directly after the beginning of battery exposure, which led to an immediate coagulation impairment of the respiratory epithelium. Over time, a strongly alkaline environment was established around the batteries. The resulting tissue colliquation caused profound tissue damage beyond the basal membrane of the mucosa, affecting the tracheobronchial cartilage after only 4 h of exposure time. After 12 h, there was significant necrosis of the annular ligaments of the trachea and the peribronchial pulmonary tissue. After completion of the experimental exposure time of 36 h, there was still a sufficient residual voltage on all button batteries of the experiments.
   Conclusions: Besides accidental ingestion, the aspiration of button batteries is a life-threatening situation. The partial or complete acute airway obstruction in the trachea or the bronchi initially is the leading symptom, as with any foreign body aspiration. However, the results of the investigations show that even after a short exposure time, relevant tissue damage can be caused by the electrolysis reaction of the battery. After 12 h, a profound destruction of cartilage, connective tissue, and smooth muscles was observed in vitro, which may cause significant consequential damage in vivo. These findings reveal the need for rapid diagnosis and immediate foreign body removal after any battery ingestion. Moreover, the results show how relevant prevention of these accidents is, and that future safety modifications of these types of battery by the manufacturers would be appropriate.
